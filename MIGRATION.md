## 🤖 Codemods

Some of the changes in this guide can be automated with _codemods_, small scripts that modify your app's source code automatically. Changes that can be codemodded are marked with a robot emoji (🤖) and the name of the transform (e.g. _button-variant-enum_). The codemods are built with [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) and can be run through the CLI that ships with Circuit UI. Here is an overview of all available options (you can view this help menu by running `yarn circuit-ui migrate --help`):

```sh
yarn circuit-ui migrate

Automatically transforms your source code to Circuit UI's latest APIs

Options:
  --transform, -t  The transform to be applied to the source code
                            [string] [required] [choices: "button-variant-enum"]
  --language, -l   The programming language of the files to be transformed
                       [string] [required] [choices: "TypeScript", "JavaScript"]
  --path, -p       A path to the folder that contains the files to be
                   transformed                           [string] [default: "."]
```

You can only run one codemod at a time and we encourage you to apply the transforms incrementally and review the changes before continuing. The codemods don't cover all edge cases, so further manual changes might be necessary.

## From v1.x to v2

### Library format

Circuit UI is now compiled with TypeScript instead of Babel ([#563](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/pull/563), [#597](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/pull/593)). ES and CJS versions are available as before, though this is not something you need to worry about since most bundlers pick the best format that they support automatically based on the `main` and `module` entries in `package.json`.

Note, however, that some modern JavaScript syntax and language features are no longer pretranspiled. Tools such as [react-scripts v2+](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) and [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) include `node_modules` in their transpilation process so Circuit UI works with them out of the box. If you have a custom build process, you should make sure that Circuit UI is transpiled like the rest of your source code.

We recommend testing your application in your oldest supported browsers to verify that it still works.

### Peer dependencies

Circuit UI v1 included React and Emotion dependencies as direct dependencies. This could cause these dependencies to be bundled twice if your application specified a different version of React or Emotion.

Circuit UI v2 moves these dependencies to peer dependencies, so Circuit UI will use whatever version your application specifies ([#485](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/pull/485)). The minimum version of React has been bumped to v16.8+ to support hooks.

If you haven't installed them already, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
# With yarn
yarn add react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# With npm
npm install --save react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

In Circuit UI v2 some functionality has been extracted into separate packages for easier maintenance. The themes have been moved to [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens), the icons are available from [@sumup/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/icons), and the number & currency utils have been completely rewritten in [@sumup/intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/intl). These packages are marked as required peer dependencies. To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
# With yarn
yarn add @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons @sumup/intl
# With npm
npm install --save @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons @sumup/intl
```

Refer to the individual packages for documentation on how to use them.

### Component static properties

Many components expose their configuration values as static properties. The `Text` component, for example, exposes its size options as `Text.KILO`, `Text.MEGA`, and `Text.GIGA`. The purpose of these static properties was to autocomplete the options and prevent typos.

Since Circuit UI is being migrated to TypeScript, the static properties are no longer necessary. VS Code can suggest and autocomplete the options based on the TypeScript types. TypeScript will warn you at build time if you use an unsupported or mistyped value. Furthermore, removing the static properties reduces the bundle size slightly.

Thus, the static properties have been removed from all components. Here's how you can pass a value to a component now:

```diff
import { Text } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const Hello = () => (
-  <Text size={Text.KILO}>Hello</Text>
+  <Text size="kilo">Hello</Text>
);
```

The affected components are: Badge, Blockquote, Button, ButtonGroup, Card, CardFooter, CardList.Item, Heading, InlineMessage, Input, List, MessageIcon, ModalFooter, NotificationIcon, Popover, ProgressBar, SubHeading, TableHeader, TableCell, Text, TextArea, and Tooltip.
