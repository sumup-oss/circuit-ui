[Circuit UI Web](https://circuit.sumup.com) is the web implementation of the [SumUp](https://sumup.com) Circuit Design System. Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety of SumUp websites and apps, while providing a consistent and inclusive user experience to our end users. In addition, the design system and component library should be easy to use for developers and designers.
