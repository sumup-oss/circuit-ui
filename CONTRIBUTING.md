### Submitting an issue

1. Check existing issues and verify that your issue is not already submitted. If a similar issue already exists, we highly recommend to add your report to that issue.
2. Open issue using one of the templates.
3. Be as detailed as possible - include the package version, what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

### Submitting a PR

2. Branch out from the latest `main` branch.
3. Code, add, commit and push your changes in your feature branch.
4. Make sure that tests and linter(s) pass locally for you.
