### Patch Changes



- [#883](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/pull/883) [`1912119f`](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/commit/1912119fd998ab9d4000e11db5dfa653fdd8c877) Thanks [@connor-baer](https://github.com/connor-baer)! - Removed unnecessary `clip-path` rules from SVGs. The rule had no visual effect on the SVGs and could cause issues when an icon was used multiple times on a page.
