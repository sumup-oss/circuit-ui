# babel-plugin-inline-react-svg

This code was generated from [airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg), specifically [airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg#86](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg/pull/86), which adds an option (`spreadDefaultProps`) to spread the extra props from the top level `svg` element onto the props object, rather than statically assigning them as `defaultProps`.
