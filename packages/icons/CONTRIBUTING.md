## Workflows

### Submitting an issue

1. Check existing issues and verify that your issue is not already submitted. If a similar issue already exists, we highly recommend to add your report to that issue.
2. Open issue using one of the templates.
3. Be as detailed as possible - include the package version, what you did, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

### Submitting a PR

1. Find an existing issue to work on or follow `Submitting an issue` to create one that you're also going to fix. Make sure to notify that you're working on a fix for the issue you picked.
2. Branch out from latest `master`.
3. Code, add, commit and push your changes in your branch.
4. Make sure that tests and linter(s) pass locally for you.
5. Submit a PR.
6. Collaborate with the codeowners/reviewers to merge this in `master`.
