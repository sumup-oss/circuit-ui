# Contributing Themes

This page outlines the process of adding or updating a theme in the `@sumup/design-tokens` package.

> Note that icons should be added by internal contributors with access to the SumUp [Figma icons library](https://www.figma.com/file/vnFVuPNlqF45rkw1u9toBC/SumUp-Iconography) (internal link). If you don't have access but would like to see an icon added to `@sumup/icons`, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/issues/new).

## Updating a theme in `@sumup/design-tokens`

1. Export the theme from Figma (how? which plugin?)
2. Save it to the repo (where? naming convention?)
3. Add the name (where?) to the generation script
4. Test the generation script (validation?)

## Caveats

### Do not hardcode the icon's color
