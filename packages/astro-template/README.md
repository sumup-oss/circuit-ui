## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

- You should have **Node.js** installed at a version equal to or above **`v18.14.1`**.

## âœ¨ Setting up a new project

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory you would like to place your project in.
3. Run `npx create-astro@latest ./my-app --template sumup-oss/circuit-ui/packages/astro-template`, where `my-app` is the name of your project.

This will create the folder `my-app` and initialize a new project inside. The project will be based on [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) and will use SumUp's [Circuit UI](https://circuit.sumup.com/) component library and [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup-oss/foundry) toolkit.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
