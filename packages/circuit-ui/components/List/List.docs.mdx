# List

<Status.Stable />

The List component is used to group pieces of content—called "list items"—together.

<Story id="typography-list--base" />
<Props />

## Component variations

### Variants

The List component comes in two variants, `ordered` or `unordered`.

- Use an ordered list to imply sequence or order (e.g. when providing a set of instructions).
- Use an unordered list when the order of the items is meaningless.

<Story id="typography-list--variants" />

### Sizes

The List component has two available sizes, `one` and `two`, matching the [`Body` component](Typography/Body)'s sizes.

For consistency, the list's size should be the same as the surrounding content's size.

<Story id="typography-list--sizes" />

### Nested lists

Lists can be nested to display a hierarchy, e.g. in a table of contents. The nested list will be visually indented.

Instead of relying on nested lists, consider splitting the content into separate sections, labeled by headings (refer to the Accessibility section below).

<Story id="typography-list--nested" />

## Accessibility

Lists are fundamental elements for structuring content. They can group pieces of content, give an overview of them, and make parsing and accessing them easier.

### Best practices

#### Keep list items concise

Keep the text in each list item concise. If you need to display more (structured) content, consider splitting it into sections instead, labeled by headings.

#### Use tables for two-dimensional data

In order to display two-dimensional data, consider using a table instead of a list. This makes parsing easier for sighted users and allows screen reader users to move vertically and horizontally across the data.

So instead of structuring content inside a list item:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Germany (Capital: Berlin)</li>
  <li>Ireland (Capital: Dublin)</li>
  <li>Canada (Capital: Ottawa)</li>
</ul>
```

Consider displaying the data in a table (you can use the [`Table` component](Components/Table)):

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Country</th>
    <th>Capital</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Germany</td>
    <td>Berlin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ireland</td>
    <td>Dublin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Canada</td>
    <td>Ottawa</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

See also the section on definition lists below.

#### Description lists

- not supported by this component
- not recommended (except for term/definition key-pair values?): screen reader discrepancies

#### Using lists for non-text UI elements

- for lists of cards, e.g. a list of articles
- not everything should be a list (can be quite noisy for SR users). think of how it is announced to screen readers and whether it makes sense for the list to be announced
