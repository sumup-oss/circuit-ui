# Checkbox

<Status variant="stable" />

A checkbox provides a way for users to make a binary choice between two options — checked or unchecked.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## When to use it

Use it to ask users to confirm something, like the acceptance of terms and conditions. Use a [CheckboxGroup](Forms/CheckboxGroup/Docs) when a user can select multiple options. Use a [Toggle](Forms/Toggle/Docs) for settings.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** accompany the checkbox with a descriptive label
- **Do** write the label in a positive manner (e.g. _"Send me reports"_ instead of _"Do not send me reports"_)
- **Do** be as specific as possible
- **Do** use sentence case (e.g. _"I agree..."_ not _"You agree..."_)
- **Do not** use the checkbox as an action button
- **Do not** rely on tooltips to explain the checkbox
- **Do not** put interactive elements in the checkbox label

## Validations

The only validation that can be applied to a checkbox is marking it as required. To show a validation error, pass the `invalid` and `validationHint` props to explain to users why the checkbox is required.

<Story of={Stories.Validations} />

### Disabled

Disabled form fields can be confusing to users, so use them with caution. Consider not displaying the field at all or add an explanation why the field is disabled.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## State

The Checkbox can be used as a controlled or uncontrolled component.

### Controlled

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Checkbox } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

function Controlled() {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);

  const onChange = () => {
    setChecked((prevChecked) => !prevChecked);
  };

  return (
    <Checkbox
      label="I accept the terms and conditions"
      value="consent"
      checked={checked}
      onChange={onChange}
    />
  );
}
```

### Uncontrolled

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Checkbox } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

function Uncontrolled() {
  const checkboxRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <Checkbox
      label="I accept the terms and conditions"
      value="consent"
      defaultChecked={false}
      ref={checkboxRef}
    />
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

The label should describe the essence of the input in a concise manner. If additional context can or should be provided, display it close to the Checkbox and associate it with the input using the [`aria-describedby` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

The `label` prop only accepts a plain, unformatted string because its value is exposed to assistive technology as the input's [accessible name](https://www.tpgi.com/what-is-an-accessible-name/). Accessible names don't have semantics or structure, so rendering e.g. an anchor or a tooltip in the label would be an accessibility issue.
