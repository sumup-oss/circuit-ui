# SidePanel

<Status.Stable />

The side panel component provides an additional surface for displaying contextual information that can support the screen's primary content.
It should always start in the closed state and appear only upon user interaction with another element.
You can also open a secondary side panel on top of the first, usually triggered from an element within the first panel.

_Note: the examples for the side panel component are best viewed in canvas mode_

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the side panel to show short-lived contextual information as part of the user's workflow.
- **Do not** use the side panel as a permanent layout element. It should always be dismissible.

## Accessibility

The side panel component has been built to be used as part of a workflow and this has an effect on its accessibility.
When the element triggering the side panel is clicked, the focus automatically shifts to the newly opened panel, facilitating a better keyboard navigation experience.
While the side panel is visible the focus remains trapped inside. On desktop resolutions the side panel is non-modal, meaning that mouse users can easily interact with the rest of the application.
Screen reader users would have to close the side panel first, which can be done easily using the Esc key.
Once the side panel is closed focus is returned to the trigger element.

## Usage in code

First, wrap the primary content of your application in the `SidePanelProvider`.
On desktop resolutions the primary content will be resized when the side panel is opened.
Additionally, the `SidePanelProvider` allows for the side panels to work seamlessly with the top navigation through the `withTopNavigation` prop.

```tsx
<SidePanelProvider withTopNavigation>
  {/* Your primary content here... */}
</SidePanelProvider>
```

<Story id="components-sidepanel--with-top-navigation" />

Then, use the `useSidePanel` hook to open a side panel from within a component.
In the most straightforward case, simply use the `setSidePanel` function, passing the minimum set of props:
- `children` - the content of your side panel
- `closeButtonLabel` - an accessibility label for the close Button
- `headline` - the title of the side panel

```tsx
import { setSidePanel, Button, Body } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

export function ShowMore() {
  const { setSidePanel } = useSidePanel();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setSidePanel({
      children: <Body>Some additional information</Body>,
      closeButtonLabel: 'Close',
      headline: 'More information',
    });
  };

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Show more</Button>;
}
```

Under the hood, `useSidePanel` generates a unique identifier for the side panel.
When you call `setSidePanel` a second time it will close the old panel and open a new one.
For stacked side panels you need to also provide the `backButtonLabel` accessibility prop.

If you want side panels to stack using a single instance of `useSidePanel`, you'll need to pass the `type` prop with a custom identifier for each panel.
You also need to pass `type` when you want to open and replace the same side panel from different instances of `useSidePanel`.

In addition to the `setSidePanel` function the `useSidePanel` hook also returns the `updateSidePanel` and `removeSidePanel` functions.
You can use `updateSidePanel` if you need to update the side panel asynchronously, though usually you should keep the side panel content self-contained.
The `removeSidePanel` function allows you to programmatically close the side panel from the component that triggered it. Closing a lower level side panel also closes the panels stacked on top of it.

It is also possible to close a side panel manually from within the side panel, e.g. closing the panel after an asynchronous API call.
This is achieved with the use of the `onBack` and `onClose` render props which are passed to the `children` prop.
`onBack` is available only for stacked side panels and imitates the behavior of the back button, closing only the topmost panel.
Calling `onClose` will close the entire stack, just like clicking on the close button in the header.
