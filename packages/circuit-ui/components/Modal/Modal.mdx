<Meta of={Stories} />

# Modal

<Status variant="stable" />

The modal component displays self-contained tasks in an overlay view, requiring the user to interact with it before returning to the underlying content.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## When to use it

Generally, use the modal dialog component sparingly. Consider displaying more complex tasks and large amounts of information on a separate page instead.

A modal dialog is a disruptive pattern that interrupts the user's current task. It should only be used when the task requires immediate attention or when the user needs to make a decision before continuing:

- Confirming a critical action, such as deleting an item or abandoning a task (also see the [NotificationModal](Notification/NotificationModal/Docs) component).
- Forms or inputs to collect small amounts of data without navigating away from the current page (e.g., login, feedback forms).
- Focused tasks like editing an item, uploading files, or reviewing details.

## How to use it

### Inline (recommended)

Place your dialog content directly in the `Modal` component:

```tsx
import { Modal, Body, Button, Heading } from '@sumup-oss/circuit-ui';
import { useState } from 'react';

function Component() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open dialog</Button>
      <Modal
        open={open}
        aria-labelledby="dialog-title"
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
      >
        {() => (
          <>
            <Heading as="h2" id="dialog-title">
              Modal title
            </Heading>
            <Body>Modal content</Body>
            <Button>Close dialog</Button>
          </>
        )}
      </Modal>
    </>
  );
}
```

### With the `useModal` hook

First, wrap your application in the `ModalProvider`:

```tsx
import { ModalProvider } from '@sumup-oss/circuit-ui';

export function App() {
  return <ModalProvider>{/* Your content here... */}</ModalProvider>;
}
```

Then, use the `useModal` hook to open a dialog from a component:

```tsx
import { useModal, Heading, Button, Body } from '@sumup-oss/circuit-ui';

export function SayHello({ name }) {
  const { setModal } = useModal();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setModal({
      children: (
        <>
          <Heading as="h2" id="dialog-title">
            Modal title
          </Heading>
          <Body>Modal content</Body>
          <Button>Close dialog</Button>
        </>
      ),
      'aria-labelledby': 'dialog-title',
      variant: 'immersive',
    });
  };

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Say hello</Button>;
}
```

## Immersive

Use the `immersive` variant to focus the user's attention on the dialog content. On small viewports, the dialog component opens up from the bottom as a fullscreen overlay on top of the page content and covers it entirely in favor of an immersive experience.

<Story of={Stories.Immersive} />

## Related components

For cases displaying simple text content but requiring immediate or critical action(s) from the user, consider using the [NotificationModal](Notification/NotificationModal/Docs) component.

## Accessibility

This component is built using the native `dialog` HTML element and follows the [WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/). It is fully accessible and supports keyboard navigation and screen readers. In browsers where `dialog` is not supported, it uses [dialog-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill).

It is important to ensure that the dialog is appropriately labeled and that the user can easily navigate and interact with it using a keyboard or screen reader.
If your dialog content has a title, make sure to provide an `aria-labelledby` attribute with the ID of the title element to the `Modal` component. Otherwise, provide an `aria-label` attribute with a descriptive label.

If your dialog displays a complex flow with multiple screens (for example: a complex form with multiple steps), make sure to programmatically set focus to the title upon landing on every step to convey to the user their evolution within your flow.

If your content contains interactive elements, the component will focus the first interactive element when the dialog opens by default. However, if you wish to focus a different element, you can provide the `initialFocusRef` prop with the ref of the element you want to focus. It is generally recommended to focus the least destructive element, such as a close or a cancel button. If the element you want to focus is not interactive, don't forget to give it a tabindex with a negative value to enable its focus.
