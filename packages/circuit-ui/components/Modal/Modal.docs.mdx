# Modal

<Status.Stable />

Modals are floating cards which overlay the primary UI. All content in a single modal should be related to completing one single task. Modals are heavy UI elements which obscure the primary user interface — avoid them where possible.

<Story id="components-modal--base" />
<Props of={ModalWrapper} />
<Props of={ModalHeader} />
<Props of={ModalFooter} />

## When to use it

Use it when you want the user to focus on a single and perhaps more complex task.

## Usage guidelines

#### General guidelines

- **Do** use modals sparingly.
- **Do** use modals when you want to isolate an action from the primary UI.
- **Do not** draw a modal over another modal.
- **Do not** fill a modal with content which has multiple end results.
- **Do not** present a modal without a user prompting a modal (e.g. as a popup).

#### Header guidelines

- **Do** use concise yet descriptive headings that label the function of the specific modal.
- **Do not** exclude headings from modals.

#### Content guidelines

- **Do** align text content to the left.
- **Do not** have more than two columns of content.

#### Footer guidelines

The modal footer contains CTA's which carry out an action on the entire modal.

- **Do** align modal CTA's to the right side of the footer.
- **Do not** have more than one "Primary - Major" CTA.

## Usage in code

There are a number of ways to use a modal in code. In some codebases, you
may opt to create a helper higher-order component that complements the
`ModalConsumer`.

### Using the ModalProvider

The benefit of using the ModalProvider is that it can be declared once at the application root, and you do not need to manage the open/closed state of the modal yourself.

```js
import {
  useModal,
  ModalProvider,
  ModalWrapper,
  ModalHeader,
  Button,
} from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const SayHello = ({ name }) => {
  const { setModal } = useModal();
  const showModal = () => {
    setModal({
      children: ({ onClose }) => (
        <ModalWrapper>
          <ModalHeader title="This is a modal" onClose={onClose} />
          Hello {name}
        </ModalWrapper>
      ),
    });
  };
  return <Button onClick={showModal}>Say hello</Button>;
};

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <ModalProvider>
      <SayHello name="World" />
    </ModalProvider>
  );
};
```

- `ModalWrapper` This is the wrapper for the body of a modal.
- `ModalHeader` This contains the title and the `X` close button.
- `ModalFooter` This component aligns its content.
