# Modal

<Status.Stable />

Modals are floating cards which overlay the primary UI. All content in a single modal should be related to completing one single task. Modals are heavy UI elements which obscure the primary user interface â€” avoid them where possible.

<Story id="components-modal--base" />

## When to use it

Use it when you want the user to focus on a single and perhaps more complex task.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use modals sparingly.
- **Do** use modals when you want to isolate an action from the primary UI.
- **Do not** draw a modal over another modal.
- **Do not** fill a modal with content which has multiple end results.
- **Do not** present a modal without a user prompting a modal (e.g. as a popup).

## Usage in code

The benefit of using the ModalProvider is that it can be declared once at the application root, and you do not need to manage the open/closed state of the modal yourself.

```js
import { useModal, ModalProvider, Button, Body } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const SayHello = ({ name }) => {
  const { setModal } = useModal();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setModal({ children: <Body>Hello {name}</Body> });
  };

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Say hello</Button>;
};

const Page = () => (
  <ModalProvider>
    <SayHello name="World" />
  </ModalProvider>
);
```
