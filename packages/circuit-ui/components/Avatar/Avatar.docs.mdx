# Avatar

<Status.Stable />

The Avatar component displays an identity or an object image. It can be passed to the [ImageInput](Forms/ImageInput) to allow users to upload an avatar.

<Story id="components-avatar--base" />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the right variant for your use case (see _Variants_ below).
- **Do** use the [ImageInput component](Forms/ImageInput) with the `component={Avatar}` prop to allow users to upload an avatar (note: the ImageInput only supports `variant="object"` for now).

## Accessibility

The Avatar can receive alt text like any other image element. However, in many cases, alt text in this context will not make sense.

For example, if the Avatar is used as an illustrative element in a products list next to each product's name, using the product name as alt text will be redundant: assistive technology will already read out the names once.

Therefore, the alt prop is not required and defaults to `""`, effectively making the Avatar invisible to assistive technology.

Howver, bear in mind that the alt text is fundamental for accessibility if the Avatar is used without textual elements, for example as part of a products grid where only the images are shown.

## Variants

There are two variants and two sizes available for the component.

### Object variant

Use the object variant with a square shape for product item purposes (e.g. product catalogue).

<Story id="components-avatar--object" />

### Identity variant

Use the identity variant with a circle shape for identity account purposes (e.g. profile, contact, business).

<Story id="components-avatar--identity" />

### Sizes

<Story id="components-avatar--sizes" />
