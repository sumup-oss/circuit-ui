# Avatar

<Status.Stable />

The Avatar component displays an identity or an object image. It can be passed to the [ImageInput](Forms/ImageInput) to allow users to upload an avatar.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the right variant for your use case (see _Variants_ below).
- **Do** use the [ImageInput component](Forms/ImageInput) with the `component={Avatar}` prop to allow users to upload an avatar (note: the ImageInput only supports `variant="object"` for now).

## Accessibility

The Avatar has a required `alt` prop to ensure that it is accessible to visually impaired users.

Alt text can be fundamental for accessibility, especially in interfaces without textual elements. For example, if the Avatar is used to render a grid of products where the names are not shown, omitting alt text would make it inaccessible.

However, if the image is purely presentational, the alt text can be set to `""`. For example, if the Avatar is used as an illustrative element in a products list next to each product's name, using the product name as alt text would be redundant: assistive technology will already read out the names once. In this case, setting `alt=""` will effectively make the Avatar invisible to assistive technology.

## Variants

There are two variants and two sizes available for the component.

### Object variant

Use the object variant with a square shape for product item purposes (e.g. product catalogue).

<Story of={Stories.ObjectVariant} />

### Identity variant

Use the identity variant with a circle shape for identity account purposes (e.g. profile, contact, business).

<Story of={Stories.IdentityVariant} />

### Sizes

<Story of={Stories.Sizes} />
