# CurrencyInput

<Status.Stable />

The CurrencyInput component indicates to the user that a number should be entered in a given currency.

<Story id="forms-input-currencyinput--base" />
<Props />

⚠️ The CurrencyInput uses `@sumup/intl` to format the currency value. It wraps the [ECMAScript Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) which is [supported by all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#search=NumberFormat) but not IE11. If you need to support older browsers, you need to include [a polyfill for the `Intl.NumberFormat` API](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat).

## Component Variations

### Currency

You can use `currency` to specify which currency the input should use.

<Story id="forms-input-currencyinput--currencies" />

### Locale

You can use `locale` to change the currency formatting locale.
For example, Euros could be formatted differently based on locale:

<Story id="forms-input-currencyinput--locales" />
