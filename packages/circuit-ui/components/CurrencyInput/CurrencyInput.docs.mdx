<Status.Stable />

The CurrencyInput component indicates to the user that a number should be entered in a given currency.

## Component Variations

### Currency

You can use `currency` to specify which currency the input should use.

<Story id="forms-input-currencyinput--currencies" />

For example, Euros could be formatted differently based on locale:

<Story id="forms-input-currencyinput--locales" />
