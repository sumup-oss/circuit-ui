# CurrencyInput

<Status.Stable />

The CurrencyInput component indicates to the user that a number should be entered in a given currency.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Component Variations

### Currency

You can use `currency` to specify which currency the input should use.

<Story of={Stories.Currencies} />

### Locale

You can use `locale` to change the currency formatting locale.
For example, Euros could be formatted differently based on locale:

<Story of={Stories.Locales} />
