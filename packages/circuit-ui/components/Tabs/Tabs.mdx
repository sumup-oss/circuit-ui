# Tabs

<Status variant="stable" />

The Tabs component allows users to navigate between different views or sections of content within the same context.

## When to use it

### Group related content

Tabs help optimize space by organizing large amounts of content into easily scannable sections, reducing cognitive load for users. They provide simple navigation between related sections that don’t require side-by-side comparison.

Examples include:

- Switching between subsets of the same data: Active Orders | Completed Orders | Cancelled Orders

- Breaking a long process into steps: Personal Info | Delivery Details | Payment Details | Review

### Navigation

Use tabs to navigate between a set of related pages within a larger website or application. For example, in a user profile section:

Overview | Posts | Comments | Settings

## How to use it

### Use the Tabs component directly

You can use the Tabs component out of the box to create a tabbed view by providing an array of tab items. Each tab should include:

- a unique id
- a clear, concise label
- the content to display when the tab is active

### Use subcomponents independently

If you need finer control over your layout, you can use the `Tab`, `TabList`, and `TabPanel` components independently. This gives you flexibility to customize the structure and behavior of your tabs while still relying on the core functionality provided by Tabs.

⚠️ When doing so, you are responsible for ensuring accessibility and managing state correctly.

- Using Tab:
  - Provide a unique `id` for each tab.
  - Add an `aria-controls` attribute that points to the id of its corresponding panel.
  - Implement keyboard navigation (e.g., arrow keys, Home/End) to support keyboard users.
- Using TabPanel:
  - Assign a unique id to each panel.
  - Ensure this id matches the `aria-controls` value of its corresponding tab.
  - Set `aria-labelledby` to reference the id of the associated tab.

### With links

Tabs render as buttons by default. In navigation contexts, you can pass a `href` prop to render them as links.
Avoid using external links, as this can create an inconsistent user experience across tabs.

### Stretched

Set the `stretched` prop to true to make all tabs expand and share the available space evenly.
