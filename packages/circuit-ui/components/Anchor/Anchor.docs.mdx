# Anchor

<Status.Stable />

The Anchor component is used to display a link or button that visually looks like a hyperlink.

<Story id="typography-anchor--as-link" />
<Props />

## Component variations

### As button

If necessary, an Anchor can be rendered as a semantic `<button>` element. It will look like an Anchor but behave like a button.

Bear in mind that this might lead to confusion for some users, since the expectation is that the Anchor should behave like a link (i.e. it should navigate), and conversely, something that behaves like a button (i.e. that performs an action) should look like a button.

<Story id="typography-anchor--as-button" />

## Accessibility

The Anchor component is most commonly used to render a hyperlink. Links are one of the most important elements in HTML. They bring the "H" in "<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>", since hypertext without links is mostly just text.

Note that the following guidelines apply to hyperlinks generally, and not only those rendered by the Anchor component.

### Best practices

#### Links should be focusable

All links must be focusable in order to be usable by all users. A focus outline should also be visible so that keyboard users know where they are when tabbing through the page.

The Anchor component is focusable by default and comes with an accessible focus outline. Do not remove it!

#### Focus order should follow a logical reading order

As detailed in [2.4.3: Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order), focus order on a page should follow a logical reading order.

Keep in mind that reading order may not be the same for sighted and screen-reader users:

- For a sighted user, reading order is influenced by styles. If an element is visually placed above another, or is emphasized through the use of color or typography, it is more likely to be read first. Therefore, if interactive, it is generally expected to receive focus first.
- For a a screen reader user, reading order is determined by the DOM. Irrespective of where elements are placed visually, what matters is their position in the DOM. What follows is that the DOM itself should be ordered logically: think about whether your interface is still understandable without styles.

#### Links should rarely open in new tabs or windows

A link that opens in a new tab or window can confuse users, especially those relying on assistive technology. [Links should only open in new tabs or windows when necessary](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G200).

For example, if there is a link to terms and conditions above a form's submit button, and form progress would be lost if the link is visited before submission, it makes sense to open the link in a new tab to preserve the user's progress. It is also a good practice to explicitly warn that the link will open in a new tab, using iconography and/or plain text ("link opens in a new tab").

In contrast, imagine that _cats.com_ features a link to _dogs.com_. It is not a good practice to make _dogs.com_ open in a new tab. Instead, trust users to know how to open the link in a new tab themselves, or how to navigate back to _cats.com_ later, if they so desire.

#### Links should have a clear purpose

The purpose of a link should be easy to determine by users. Ideally, a link's text should define the content of the linked resource, much like a heading's text defines the content of its section. The link's text could also match the destination page's name, to give users confirmation that they arrived in the right place after navigating.

[2.4.4: Link Purpose (In Context)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) states that link purpose must be inferrable from the link's context, i.e. the same paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link. So for example, a user should be able to understand what a link does by reading the surrounding paragraph.

A best practice is to go even further, and attempt to make link purpose understandable even out of context, by the link text only. The reason behind this best practice is primarily that it's common for screen reader users to find their way on the web by pulling up a list of links on a page. The WCAG level AAA success criterion [2.4.9: Link Purpose (Link Only)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-link-only) makes this a requirement.

_Note: while it is tempting at this point to add visually hidden text (or an `aria-label`) to a link to make its purpose clear out of context for screen reader users, we recommend against it: voice control users may not be able to target the link if its accessible name doesn't match its visible text._

#### link with the same text should have the same destination

- avoid using the same link text pointing to different destinations (typical: "click here")
- avoid using different link texts when pointing to the same destination in different places (also required in 3.2.4)

#### link text length

- better to keep links short, for when navigating lists of links? (similar to list items) i.e. no link paragraphs
- add stricture to link text, see https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/a11y-links.html#use-punctuation

#### link styles

Link should be underlined and blue (both common patterns)

- 3:1 contrast with surrounding text if identified by color alone, see 1.4.1 use of color https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color
- but underline is a best practice (common pattern and serves users that don't see color at all)

#### more link features

(not supported by our component)

- visited link (already announced by screen readers, esp. useful in link-heavy web pages)
- external link (indicate the link is to an external siteâ€”relates to the target=\_blank above)
- on-page link (indicate that the link is to a node on the same webpage (#))
- download links (indicate that the link downloads a fileâ€”e.g. a link to a PDF or mp3 is likely to trigger a download)
- button links (indicate buttons that look like links, i.e. links that perform an action like opening an overlay. Good for sighted usersâ€“the button role is already announced by SRs)

#### careful with block links

a.k.a. clickable cards

- handled very differently depending on the AT/SR, might be better to link only a part of the block element

- Tab through your interface and verify that all links receive focus, that they have a visible outline when focused, ...
