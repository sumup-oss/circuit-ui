# Anchor

<Status.Stable />

The Anchor component is used to display a link or button that visually looks like a hyperlink.

<Story id="typography-anchor--as-link" />
<Props />

## Component variations

### As button

should this generally be avoided to prevent surprising behavior?

<Story id="typography-anchor--as-button" />

## Accessibility

### Best practices

#### keyboard navigation

- all links should receive focus (i.e. no `tabindex="-1"`)
- focus styles should be visible

#### focus order (2.4.3)

- should follow a logical reading order (might be several, match one)
- think of both a sighted keyboard user (logical order is visual) and a screen reader user (logical order is the DOM)

#### opens in new tab/window

- prev guidelines recommended this when linking to a separate website: no
- only when necessary: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G200
  - invalid example: link to a separate website in an article, opens in a new tab
  - valid example: link to TOC in a signup form, opens in a new tab (otherwise form progress is lost—but recommended to explicitly warn about the new tab, cf. "more link features" below)
- announced by SRs?

#### link purpose

- link purpose = link text _and_ link context (roughly: same paragraph) (AAA: link text alone, see 2.4.9)
- should define the content of the linked resource (e.g. page name)
- good practice to match destination page name with link name, for continuity/confirmation

#### link with the same text should have the same destination

- avoid using the same link text pointing to different destinations (typical: "click here")
- avoid using different link texts when pointing to the same destination in different places (also required in 3.2.4)

#### link text length

- better to keep links short, for when navigating lists of links? (similar to list items) i.e. no link paragraphs
- add stricture to link text, see https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/a11y-links.html#use-punctuation

#### link styles

Link should be underlined and blue (both common patterns)

- 3:1 contrast with surrounding text if identified by color alone, see 1.4.1 use of color https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color
- but underline is a best practice (common pattern and serves users that don't see color at all)

#### more link features

(not supported by our component)

- visited link (already announced by screen readers, esp. useful in link-heavy web pages)
- external link (indicate the link is to an external site—relates to the target=\_blank above)
- on-page link (indicate that the link is to a node on the same webpage (#))
- download links (indicate that the link downloads a file—e.g. a link to a PDF or mp3 is likely to trigger a download)
- button links (indicate buttons that look like links, i.e. links that perform an action like opening an overlay. Good for sighted users–the button role is already announced by SRs)

#### careful with block links

a.k.a. clickable cards

- handled very differently depending on the AT/SR, might be better to link only a part of the block element
- (cf. research on notificationbanner link)
