# ImageInput

<Status.Stable />

The ImageInput component allows users to upload images, through drag and drop (desktop only), and local file browsing. It can be used on its own or as part of a form.

<Story id="components-imageinput--base" />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the Avatar component if the image input is read-only for the user.
- **Do not** â€¦
