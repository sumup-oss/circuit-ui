# ImageInput

<Status.Stable />

The ImageInput component allows users to upload avatar images. It can be used on its own or as part of a form.

<Story id="components-ImageInput--base" />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use a short and concise alert message. Consider the maximum amount of characters in one line (50-60, including spaces) for an optimal readability.
- **Do not** use the ImageInput component if the avatar is read-only for the user, use the [Avatar](Components/Avatar) component instead.
