# ImageInput

<Status.Stable />

The ImageInput component allows users to upload images. It can be used on its own or as part of a form.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

Refer to the `Stateful` component story for a simplified code usage example.

- **Do** use the `onChange` callback to immediately trigger an image upload when the user has selected one, even when the component is being used as part of a form. Faster form submissions add to a delightful user experience.
- **Do not** use the ImageInput component if the image is read-only for the user. Instead, use the visual component from the ImageInput's `component` prop by itself, for example the [Avatar](Components/Avatar).

## Input states

### Existing image

When an `src` prop is provided, the ImageInput renders a "Clear" icon instead of the "Add" icon. It also forwards the prop to the visual component passed as a prop. Clicking the "Clear" icon clears the input.

<Story of={Stories.WithImage} />

### Invalid

When an image upload fails, set the `invalid` prop to true to render invalid styles, and show the user a clear and concise error message using the `validationHint` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Invalid} />

## Custom component

The ImageInput has drop-in support for the [Avatar](Components/Avatar) component as a visual element.

However, a custom component can also be used in other cases to display an ImageInput with different dimensions.

There are some caveats with this approach:

- A custom placeholder will also need to be provided to match the custom aspect ratio. Refer to the `CustomComponent` stories for code examples.
- Currently, the `ImageInput` only supports rectangular components in order to correctly apply state-specific styles. Please omit border-radius styles from your custom components, they will be set to a fixed 12px radius by the ImageInput.

### Using an img element

<Story of={Stories.CustomComponentImg} />

### Using a div element

<Story of={Stories.CustomComponentDiv} />
