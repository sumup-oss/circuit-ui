# ImageInput

<Status.Stable />

The ImageInput component allows users to upload images. It can be used on its own or as part of a form.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Usage guidelines

Refer to the `Stateful` component story for a simplified code usage example.

### Uploading an image

When an ImageInput is used as part of a form, there are two possible patterns for uploading the image picked by a user:

1. upload the image as soon as the user selected it (`onChange`)
2. upload the image when the form is submitted (`onSubmit`)

If possible, prefer the first approach: APIs tend to expect image URLs, not blobs, so uploading an image during form submission is likely to require request chaining (a first request uploads the image to an object storage provider and returns an object URL, a second request sends the object URL along with other form data to some backend service). (If the backend service you're working with handles object storage, choose the second approach.)

### Accepting HEIF image uploads

By default, the ImageInput component renders an `<input type="file" accept="image/*" />`.

However, when using `allow="image/*"`, some browsers file pickers will not allow uploading [HEIF images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format), an image standard widely adopted by Apple and default iPhone photo format (as of October 2022, this is the case in Chrome).

Therefore, it probably makes sense to override the `allow` attribute by passing an `allow` prop to the component ([source](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/blob/be740a23953401e91e8d9dd4988de4e887f2d882/packages/circuit-ui/components/ImageInput/ImageInput.tsx#L439)) as follows:

- **If your service supports HEIF images** (e.g. the uploaded image is attached to a support email, and the recipient can open it using macOS Sierra or later)
  - **Use `accept="image/*,.heic"`**. This will ensure that a HEIF image is recognised as valid by browser file pickers, including on Chrome.
  - Tell users what formats are supported (and any other limitations such as file size, dimensions, etc). Use the ImageInput's `validationHint` prop ([example](https://circuit.sumup.com/?path=/story/forms-imageinput--base&args=validationHint:JPEG+and+HEIF+images+are+supported)).
  - ⚠️ The [Circuit UI ImageInput](https://circuit.sumup.com/?path=/story/forms-imageinput--base)'s image preview will not work, so users might think the file was not correctly uploaded. (Alternatively, there's a ["FileInput" component proposal on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2yHC0dK9pFEhLsMxk62XZY/Circuit-UI-Web?node-id=4921%3A27) (🔒 internal link). Contributions welcome!)
- **If your service doesn't support HEIF images** (e.g. the uploaded image will be displayed—without conversion—on a SumUp online store)
  - **Use explicit MIME types for all supported formats**, e.g. `accept="image/jpeg,image/png"`. Safari will automatically convert HEIF images to a supported format. (Unfortunately, other browsers won't, so e.g. Chrome users on macOS won't be able to upload HEIF image.)
  - Tell users what formats are supported (and any other limitations such as file size, dimensions, etc). Use the ImageInput's `validationHint` prop ([example](https://circuit.sumup.com/?path=/story/forms-imageinput--base&args=validationHint:JPEG+and+PNG+images+are+supported)).

Note: since the recommended `accept` value is product-specific, the `ImageInput` implementation will keep `allow="image/*"` as a default.

For details on the testing and rationale behind these recommendations, [refer to this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/heif-files-with-input-type-file-9whw8l).

## Input states

### Existing image

When an `src` prop is provided, the ImageInput renders a "Clear" icon instead of the "Add" icon. It also forwards the prop to the visual component passed as a prop. Clicking the "Clear" icon clears the input.

<Story of={Stories.WithImage} />

### Invalid

When an image upload fails, set the `invalid` prop to true to render invalid styles, and show the user a clear and concise error message using the `validationHint` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Invalid} />

## Custom component

The ImageInput has drop-in support for the [Avatar](Components/Avatar) component as a visual element.

However, a custom component can also be used in other cases to display an ImageInput with different dimensions.

There are some caveats with this approach:

- A custom placeholder will also need to be provided to match the custom aspect ratio. Refer to the `CustomComponent` stories for code examples.
- Currently, the `ImageInput` only supports rectangular components in order to correctly apply state-specific styles. Please omit border-radius styles from your custom components, they will be set to a fixed 12px radius by the ImageInput.
