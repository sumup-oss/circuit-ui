# Body

<Status.Stable />

The Body component is used to present content to our users.

<Story id="typography-body--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

ðŸš§ can these be removed in favor of the a11y section? (same in BodyLarge)

- **Do** use the [Headline](Typography/Headline) and [SubHeadline](Typography/SubHeadline) components as well as semantic HTML elements to split the content into sections.
- **Do** use spacing to better format textual information, such as spacing between different paragraphs. The [`spacing()`](Features/Style-Mixins/spacing) style mixin is recommended.
- **Do** use different variants of the Body component instead of styling it manually.
- **Do** use the `as` prop to render the desired HTML element. The Body renders a `<p>` by default, except with the `highlight` or `quote` variants (see below).

## Component variations

### Sizes

The Body component comes in two sizes. Use the default `one` size in most cases. Consider using the [BodyLarge component](Typography/BodyLarge) for large typography in specific cases.

<Story id="typography-body--sizes" />

### Variants

The Body component accepts five different variantsâ€”`highlight`, `quote`, `success`, `error` and `subtle`â€”to tailor it according to the content we are presenting.

The `highlight` variant will render a `<strong>` element by default, while the `quote` variant will render a `blockquote`.

<Story id="typography-body--variants" />

ðŸš§ **Important**: the `success` and `error` variants only change the text's color. Keep in mind that this will not be accessible to some users: provide alternative cues such as icons (and live regions, images, explicit wording etc.) (link to a11y section)

## Accessibility

### Best practices

#### Break text up into sections

In order to make content easier to digest (especially on content-heavy pages such as articles or landing pages), break text up into sections.

- Use semantic HTML elements and headings (use the [Headline](Typography/Headline) component) to build sections into your markup
- Add spacing between paragraphs and sections for sighted users (use the [`spacing()` style mixin](Features/Style-Mixins/Spacing))

This is beneficial to everyone, but critical for users with cognitive, language or learning disabilities (such as dyslexia or ADHD).

#### Write simple copy

Similarly to how breaking text up into sections helps users _parse_ content, writing concise and simple copy helps users _understand_ content.

- Avoid the figurative use of words, or specialized words ([3.1.3: Unusual Words](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/unusual-words))
- Allow users to access the expanded form of abbreviations ([3.1.4: Abbreviations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/abbreviations))
- Write content as clearly and simply as possible ([3.1.5: Reading Level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reading-level))

_Note: the success criteria referenced above are intended for AAA conformance. Though they are not requirements, they are a best pracice and following them will improve the accessibility of our content._

#### Complement text with images

Images, graphs, or other illustrations can help users contextualize and/or understand a piece of content.

Visuals should usually complement textâ€”and not replace itâ€”unless an excellent description is provided as alternative text.

#### Translate content

Translate content intended for a linguistically diverse audience, and make it easy for users to change the page's language.

Bear in mind that machine translation is often inaccurate: prefer professional translation in order to give the best possible experience to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

#### ðŸš§ Do not rely on color alone

(similar to point below?)

#### ðŸš§ Beware of status messages

Use live regionsâ€”or built-in components

### ðŸš§ Resources

#### Visualizing document structure

Use a tool like [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to extract structure from a page (in Wave, you'll find the page structure under the _Structure_ tab). Verify that your copy is accurately grouped and labeled by headings.
