# Body

<Status.Stable />

The Body component is used to present content to our users.

<Story id="typography-body--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the [Headline](Typography/Headline) and [SubHeadline](Typography/SubHeadline) components as well as semantic HTML elements to split the content into sections.
- **Do** use spacing to better format textual information, such as spacing between different paragraphs. The [`spacing()`](Features/Style-Mixins/spacing) style mixin is recommended.
- **Do** use different variants of the Body component instead of styling it manually.
- **Do** use the `as` prop to render the desired HTML element. The Body renders a `<p>` by default, except with the `highlight` or `quote` variants (see below).

## Component variations

### Sizes

The Body component comes in two sizes. Use the default `one` size in most cases. Consider using the [BodyLarge component](Typography/BodyLarge) for large typography in specific cases.

<Story id="typography-body--sizes" />

### Variants

The Body component accepts five different variants—`highlight`, `quote`, `success`, `error` and `subtle`—to tailor it according to the content we are presenting.

The `highlight` variant will render a `<strong>` element by default, while the `quote` variant will render a `blockquote`.
