# CarouselPagination

<Status variant="stable" />

The carousel pagination component allows to display larger amounts of content in limited spaces by dividing these into multiple pieces to be discoverd by the users through interaction.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Usage

Consider adjusting the layout or using a different component if the number of pages/slides exceeds five.

For inline use cases, create an illusion of continuity through cropped images or text, so users quickly understand that they can get more content by moving beyond the screen edge.

Do not place the carousel cue on busy, dynamic backgrounds (i.e. on images, illustrations), in order to ensure optimal contrast and discoverability.

- lazy-load hidden content
- ensure content outside the viewport is searchable and becomes visible on focus

<Story of={Stories.Carousel} />

## Accessibility

- size ([minimum tap target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html): 24px)
- announce next page content?
- move focus?
