# BodyLarge

<Status.Stable />

The BodyLarge component is used to render content with large typography. Typically, large typography is intended for landing pages. In most cases, the [Body](Typography/Body) should be used instead.

<Story id="typography-bodylarge--base" />
<Props />

## Component variations

### Variants

The BodyLarge accepts five different variants—`highlight`, `quote`, `success`, `error` and `subtle`—to tailor it according to the content we are presenting.

The `highlight` variant will render a `<strong>` element by default, while the `quote` variant will render a `blockquote`.

<Story id="typography-bodylarge--variants" />

## Accessibility

All accessibility guidelines for the [Body component](Typography/Body) also apply to the BodyLarge component.
