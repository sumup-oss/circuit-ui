# BodyLarge

<Status.Stable />

The BodyLarge component is used to render content with large typography. Typically, large typography is intended for landing pages. In most cases, the [Body](Typography/Body) should be used instead.

<Story id="typography-bodylarge--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the [Title](Typography/Title), [Headline](Typography/Headline), and [SubHeadline](Typography/SubHeadline) components as well as semantic HTML elements to split the content into sections.
- **Do** use spacing to better format textual information, such as spacing between different paragraphs. The [`spacing()`](Features/Style-Mixins/spacing) style mixin is recommended.
- **Do** use different variants of the BodyLarge component instead of styling it manually.
- **Do** use the `as` prop to render the desired HTML element. The BodyLarge renders a `<p>` by default, except with the `highlight` or `quote` variants (see below).

## Component variations

### Variants

The BodyLarge accepts five different variants—`highlight`, `quote`, `success`, `error` and `subtle`—to tailor it according to the content we are presenting.

The `highlight` variant will render a `<strong>` element by default, while the `quote` variant will render a `blockquote`.
