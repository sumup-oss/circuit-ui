# NotificationInline

The Notification Inline component non-disruptively provides quick and contextual inline notification and it is integrated within the content section.
Inline notifications are frequently used to provide additional guidance to the user, like positive feedback, confirmation about an action or errors in forms, cards or dialog boxes.

## Usage guidelines

- Be concise, specific and short in the message and always provide a body copy.
- Be descriptive and give users clear next steps.
- Inline notifications are part of the content and should be placed near their related part of the content.
- Do not cover other content with inline notifications.
- If needed an optional headline or an action button can be included.
