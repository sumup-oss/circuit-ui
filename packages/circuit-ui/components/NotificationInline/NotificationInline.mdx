# NotificationInline

<Status.Stable />

The `NotificationInline` component renders an inline notification within the content flow. It is frequently used to provide additional guidance or to draw attention to a section of the interface.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Component variations

### Notification variants

<Story of={Stories.Variants} />

- Use the 'info' variant for informational, neutral messages.
- Use the 'success' variant the successful messages.
- Use the 'warning' variant for warning messages, and other information a user should be aware of.
- Use the 'danger' variant for error messages. Be descriptive and give users clear next steps.

### Dismissable notifications

The notification can optionally be made dismissable by passing an `onClose` method and a `closeButtonLabel`.

<Story of={Stories.Dismissable} />

### Notifications with a headline and/or action button

If needed, an optional headline can be included above the body copy. Note that the headline can be passed as a string (renders an `h3`), or as an object with the properties `label` (the heading text) and `as` (the heading level, from `h2` to `h6`). Make sure to render the appropriate heading level based on your page's heading structure: refer to the [`Headline` component docs](Typography/Headline) for more details.

Likewise, an optional action button will prompt the user to take a specific action in relation to the notification.

<Story of={Stories.WithHeadlineAndAction} />

## Accessibility

### Best practices

#### Place notifications close to their related content

Inline notifications are part of the content flow, and should be placed near their related content. Make use of headings and semantic markup to programmatically group content into meaningful sections.

#### Avoid dynamically rendering a notification

If rendering a notification on the page dynamically, e.g. after a form submission, set up a [live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to ensure that the new content is picked up by assistive technology.

Alternatively, use the [`NotificationToast`](Notifications/NotificationToast), which comes with a live region built in.

An even more robust pattern would be to navigate on form submission and to render an `InlineNotification` statically on a new page. This would also allow for a notification with an action, which toasts don't support.
