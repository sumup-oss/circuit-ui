# Selector

<Status.InReview />
<Status.Description>
  This component is under design review. Consider using radio buttons or
  checkboxes instead.
</Status.Description>

The Selector component should only by used as options passed to the [SelectorGroup](Forms/Selector/SelectorGroup) component.

<Story id="forms-selector--base" />
<Props />

## Component variations

### Selected

<Story id="forms-selector--selected" />

### Disabled

<Story id="forms-selector--disabled" />

### Sizes

The Selector's `size` determines its padding. There are three available sizes:

- **mega**, the default size
- **kilo**, used when there are sizing constraints
- **flexible**, used for more complex content within selector which may define its own padding. Adds minimal equal padding on all sides.

**Warning**: for accessibility reasons, we recommend against using the `flexible` size and may deprecate it in the future. Refer to the [SelectorGroup component](Forms/Selector/SelectorGroup)'s documentation for details.

<Story id="forms-selector--sizes" />
