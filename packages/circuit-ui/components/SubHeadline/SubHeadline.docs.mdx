# SubHeadline

<Status.Stable />

Subheadlines help to break up larger related chunks of content in the same section. They are usually used to separate sections within a card.

<Story id="typography-subheadline--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use subheadlines to break complex and longer chunks of content in a page or card
- **Do not** use a subheadline without a heading title for the same section

## Content guidelines

Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has rank 1 (`h1`), the least important heading rank 6 (`h6`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher-ranked section.

Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Ensure that an `h2` is not followed directly by an `h4`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, an `h2` beginning a new section can follow an `h4` as it closes the previous section.
