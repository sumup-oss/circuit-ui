# SubHeadline

<Status.Stable />

Subheadings help users break through larger related contents in the same section.
They are usually used to separate sections within a card.

<Story id="typography-subheadline--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use subheadings to break complex and longer contents in a page or card
- **Do not** use a subheading without a heading title for the same section
