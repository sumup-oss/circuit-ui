# Input

<Status variant="stable" />

A text field is an input field for inserting short text and numbers.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## When to use it

When you need short textual information from the user such as email address, first name, phone number, street name, etc.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always accompany an input field with a visible label.
- **Do** use one input per row, unless two fields are closely interrelated (e.g. first and last name).
- **Do not** use input fields for requiring longer textual information from the user.
- **Do not** communicate that an input field is required on the label or the placeholder. We assume that everything is required for the user unless explicitly said so.
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks.

## Validations

Use the `validationHint` to communicate the expected response to users. Communicate validation issues to users with the following props:

- `invalid`: The user needs to change the value to proceed.
- `hasWarning`: The user is recommended to change the value, but can proceed without doing so. Use it when the provided value could have unintended side-effects.
- `showValid`: The user is reassured that the value is valid. Use sparingly.

### Optional

Mark optional text fields instead of mandatory ones. Do not use the asterisk character “\*” to mark text fields, but use the explicit “(optional)” label.

<Story of={Stories.Optional} />

### Disabled

You should use only when its a critical information from the user that we
already have or need and we do not want the user to edit it easily. A disabled
field should only be open for editing again if a button is clicked.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

#### Usage guidelines

- **Do** try to tell that a text input is not valid as soon as we realize it.
- **Do** display the error message that corresponds to the input above the input field.
- **Do** use passive voice in the error message to avoid giving direct blame to our users, for example "Password is required" instead of "You didn't set a password"
- **Do not** use long sentences to describe why something is invalid, be direct and tell the user how to fix it.
- **Do not** place validation descriptions for formatting such as "Use only numbers". We should always try to take care of this automatically for our users (such as eliminating space in credit card inputs)

## Placeholder

An input field must always have a placeholder, which is a short example of the information required that helps the user to understand what kind of information is needed. (For instance, an Address Field could have a placeholder: "Grunerstrasse 13")

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** make the placeholder contextual to the language and market.
- **Do not** repeat the same content in the placeholder as the label.
- **Do not** communicate that a field is optional in the placeholder, you should do it in the label.
