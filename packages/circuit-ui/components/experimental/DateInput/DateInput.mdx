<Props />

- can't use `input[type="date"]` because of accessibility issues and lack of customization
- date range selection
- closing the popover after date selection
- free-form input
- autocomplete
- context on mobile dialog: field name (and current value?)
- abstract away dialog? -> leave for later once re-implementing the Modal components
- button to open calendar? open on focus? (how to free-form enter on mobile?) (https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/ vs https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-datepicker/)
