# ListItem

<Status.Stable />

The ListItem component is used to represent data in a structured and concise manner.
It covers various levels of complexity by being split into several designated areas that can hold textual, presentational or interactive components.
In its simplest form the ListItem only requires a label.
While ListItem can be used on its own, in most cases the ListItemGroup component should be used to render a list of items.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the `navigation` variant when the items are links to other parts of the application or open a side panel.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** use size `24` Circuit UI icon, a custom 48x48 image, or other similar sized components, such as a circular Badge, for the `prefix` if applicable.
- **Do** use the default styles for `label`, `details`, `suffixLabel` and `suffixDetails` by passing a string instead of a custom component.
- **Do** use size `one` Body for the `label` and `suffixLabel` when using a custom component if applicable.
- **Do** use size `two` subtle Body for the `details` and `suffixDetails` when using a custom component if applicable.
- **Do** use `&middot;` to split the `details` line in two sections if applicable.
- **Do not** use `suffixDetails` on their own without also providing a `suffixLabel`.
- **Do not** use a combination of a custom `suffix` component and `suffixLabel`.

### Variants

In addition to the standard `action` variant there is also the `navigation` variant.
It shows a chevron icon in the suffix area of the ListItem indicating to the user that clicking on the item
will either change the page or lead to a major change in the layout, such as opening a side panel.

### Elements

A standard Circuit UI icon can be used as a `prefix` to provide additional visual context to the user.

The `prefix` can also be used for custom components, such as a circular Badge or a Checkbox.

<Story id="components-listitem--with-custom-prefix" />

When the `label` is provided as a string it is rendered as a size `one` Body and is truncated when it gets too long.
A custom component can be used for special cases, such as a multiline label.

<Story id="components-listitem--with-custom-label" />

The `details` line can be used to provide additional textual and visual information. It can be a string or a custom component.

<Story id="components-listitem--with-details" />

<Story id="components-listitem--with-custom-details" />

The suffix area can hold a combination of `suffixLabel` and `suffixDetails` or a standalone custom `suffix` component. The `suffixLabel` and `suffixDetails` can be custom components as well, but they should be used only for textual information.

The ListItem component becomes interactive when it receives the `onClick` or `href` prop.
This applies additional styles and accessibility features.

Make sure to use the `navigation` variant when applicable, such as in this case when the ListItem acts as a link.

With interactive list items it is also possible to set additional states like `selected` and `disabled`.

<Story id="components-listitem--selected" />

<Story id="components-listitem--disabled" />
