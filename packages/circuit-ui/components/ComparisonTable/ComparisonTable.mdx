## Usage guidelines

- This component was design for the specific case of comparing pricing tiers offered by Sumup. It may not be suitable for other use cases.
- Limit the number of plans to compare to a maximum of 4.

## Content guidelines

- Keep feature titles short and self-explanatory: users should understand the feature at a glance without needing extra explanation.
- A feature can have an optional `description` when needed. Use descriptions only when necessary: too much text can overwhelm users.
- When a feature requires additional clarification that wouldn’t fit naturally in the table, you can add a `toggletip` property that could contain a more detailed description of you feature and will appear as a [Toggletip](Components/Toggletip/Docs) component in the table. Tooltips should be the exception, not the rule, so use them sparingly. If a feature requires a lengthy explanation, it’s better to link to a help page instead.
