## Usage guidelines

- This component was design for the specific case of comparing pricing tiers offered by Sumup. It may not be suitable for other use cases.
- Limit the number of plans to compare to a maximum of 4.

## Content guidelines

- Keep feature titles short & self-explanatory: Users should understand the feature at a glance without needing extra explanation.
- Use descriptions only when necessary: too much text can overwhelm users.
- When a feature requires additional clarification that wouldn’t fit naturally in the table, consider using a Toggletip. Tooltips should be the exception, not the rule, so use them sparingly. If a feature requires a lengthy explanation, it’s better to link to a help page instead
