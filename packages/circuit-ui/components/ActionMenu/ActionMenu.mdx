# ActionMenu

An ActionMenu displays a list of subsequent actions, when interacting with an actionable component.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

- The reference element, which triggers ActionMenu, can be primary, secondary, tertiary buttons, an overflow icon, or components with embedded buttons such as the [ImageInput](Forms/ImageInput) component.
- Each ActionMenu action item is represented by an appropriate HTML element (e.g., a button element or an anchor element).
- If needed, the dividing line can be used to separate ActionMenu action items.
- The leading icon is optional.
- The ActionMenu is powered by [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-dom). You can easily change the position of the ActionMenu relative to the reference element by passing in the `placement` prop. If you want to offset the ActionMenu in the x and y directions, use the `offset` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Offset} />

## Related components

This component is built on top of the low level [Popover](Components/Popover/Docs) component. If this component does not meet your requirements, you can use the Dialog component directly to build your own custom popover component.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use clear, concise and actionable labels for ActionMenu items
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action option to be taken and put the option order in logical order
