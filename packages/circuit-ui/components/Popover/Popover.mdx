# Popover

The Popover component shows content on top of other page content in an ephemeral manner.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />
## When to use it

In most cases, the [Tooltip](Components/Tooltip/Docs) or the [Toggletip](Components/Toggletip/Docs) components should cover your needs. However, if you need to show more interactive content, the Popover component will be the best fit.
Examples:

- To display content in dropdown types, such as profile menus, filters, media previews.. etc.
- To display list of actions that can be taken on a specific item (use the `actions` prop)

## How to use it

- The component will either accept an `actions` prop, which is an array of objects, each object representing an action item in the Popover, or a `children` prop, which represents the content of the Popover, but not both at the same time.
- The reference element, which triggers the Popover, can be a primary, secondary, tertiary button, an overflow icon, or components with embedded buttons such as the [ImageInput](Forms/ImageInput) component.
- When using the `actions` prop, each Popover action item is represented by an appropriate HTML element (e.g., a button element or an anchor element).
- If needed, the dividing line can be used to separate Popover action items.
- The leading icon is optional.
- On small screens, the popover will show your content inside a [Modal](Components/Modal/Docs) component.
- The Popover is powered by [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react-dom). You can easily change the position of the Popover relative to the reference element by passing in the `placement` prop. If you want to offset the Popover in the x and y directions, use the `offset` prop.
- if the `hasArrow` prop is set to `true`, the Popover will have an arrow pointing to the reference element, and will ignore the provided `offset` prop to position the arrow correctly.
