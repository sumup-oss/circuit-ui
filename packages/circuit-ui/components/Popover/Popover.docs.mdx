# Popover

Popover menus are a common pattern to display a list of subsequent action options, when interacting with an actionable component.

<Story id="components-popover--base" />
<Props of={Popover} />

- Triggers of Popover can be primary, secondary, tertiary buttons, an overflow icon, or components with embedded buttons such as the [ImageInput component](Forms/ImageInput).
- Each Popover action item is represented by an appropriate HTML element (button or a).
- If needed the dividing line can be used to separate Popover action items.
- The leading icon is optional.
- The Popover is powered by React Popper [https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/] which means you can easily change the Popover placement by simply passing the placement prop.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use clear, concise and actionable labels for Popover items
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action option to be taken and put the option order in logical order

<Story id="components-popover--with-icon" />
