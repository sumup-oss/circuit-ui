# SkipLink

<Status variant="experimental" />

The SkipLink Component is used to provide a shortcut to the main content of a page.
It is inspired by the [WCAG 2.1 guideline 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G1).


<Story of={Stories.Base}  inline={false} />

<Props />

## Usage

### When to use it

This shortcut is particularly useful for users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

The SkipLink component is an [Anchor](Typography/Anchor/Docs) component with special styling: it is visually hidden until focused, at which point it becomes visible and can be interacted with.

In most cases, one skip link is enough. If your website has few navigation items, it might not even be necessary. The goal is to limit the "link-clutter" and make the navigation experience as efficient as possible.

### How to use it

The SkipLink component is typically placed at the top of a page, before the main content.
It is already included in the [TopNavigation](Navigation/TopNavigation/Docs) and [SideNavigation](Navigation/SideNavigation/Docs) components.
