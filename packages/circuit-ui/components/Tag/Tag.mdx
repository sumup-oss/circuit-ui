# Tag

<Status.Stable />

Tags enable the user to add or remove attributes to a given content, for
example: transaction history for a given day or week.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Best practices

- For content within the tag, the text should be no longer than 30 characters.
- Be as concise as possible in wording, limit to one to two words, as to not
  take up too much space.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** make tags removable by default in order for users to have the
  ability to add and remove them.
- **Do** display tags above or within proximity to the content that needs to be
  filtered.
- **Do** ensure that icons are always displayed on the left of the label, in
  a canvas of 24px.
