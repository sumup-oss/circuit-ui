# SelectorGroup

<Status variant="stable" />

The SelectorGroup component allows users to select a single or multiple options from a group.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Component variations

### Multiple selection

Pass the `multiple` prop to use a checkbox group under the hood instead of the default radio button group.

<Story of={Stories.Multiple} />

### Descriptions

Use the `description` prop to add details to each option.

<Story of={Stories.Descriptions} />

## Accessibility

Selectors are semantically either radio buttons or checkboxes. When it comes to accessibility, this means that they should be treated as input elements, with considerations such as proper labeling, keyboard operability, etc.

### Best practices

#### Write clear and concise labels

The `label` prop passed to one of the SelectorGroup's `options` constitutes the Selector's label. This label should be clear and concise, and should not contain any formatted or semantic content (such as headings or lists).

This is because the label in this case is also the input's accessible name, exposed to assistive technology as plain text. Using non-phrasing content in a label element is invalid HTML.

### Resources

#### Testing label accessibility

Use a tool like [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to turn off styles (in Wave, you can use the "Styles" toggle). _Note: this feature doesn't work on this page since Storybook renders the docs in an iframe._

This will expose the component's underlying checkboxes or radio buttons. Verify that the labels are appropriate.
