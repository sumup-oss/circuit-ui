# Title

<Status.Stable />

The Title component is used to render headings with large typography. Typically, large typography is intended for landing pages. In most cases, the [Headline](Typography/Headline) should be used instead.

<Story id="typography-title--base" />
<Props />

## Accessibility

Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has rank 1 (`h1`), the least important heading rank 6 (`h6`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher-ranked section.

Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Ensure that an `h2` is not followed directly by an `h4`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, an `h2` beginning a new section can follow an `h4` as it closes the previous section.

## Component variations

### Sizes

The Title component comes in four sizes. In most cases, use the [Headline component](Typography/Headline) component instead to render headings.
