# Title

<Status.Stable />

The Title component is used to render headings with very large typography. Typically, large typography is intended for landing pages. In most cases, a [Headline](Typography/Headline) should be used instead.

<Story id="typography-title--base" />
<Props />

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use the [Headline](Typography/Headline) component for headings in most cases.
- **Do** nest headings sequentially according to the Content guidelines below.

## Content guidelines

Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has rank 1 (`h1`), the least important heading rank 6 (`h6`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher-ranked section.

Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Ensure that an `h2` is not followed directly by an `h4`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, an `h2` beginning a new section can follow an `h4` as it closes the previous section.
