# NotificationToast

<Status.Stable />

<Story id="notification-notificationtoast--base" />
<Props />

The notification toast component non-disruptively provides quick and contextual feedback to the user. It can be based on the outcome of an action (i.e. saving a form) or it can pop up without having been triggered explicitly (i.e. a toast message "You made a new sale" showing real time sales in an app).

## When to use it

The notification toast should be used for a feedback on micro actions (i.e. successfully/unsuccessfully saving some information).

## Usage guidelines

- Be concise, specific and short in the message and always provide a body copy. If needed an optional headline can be included above the body copy.
- The notification toast floats above the content, positioned at the bottom of the screen, centralized horizontally within the content area.
- For multiple stacked toasts, the new toast slides on top of the previous one. The timeout of the stacked toasts follows chronological order.
- The auto-dismiss duration is adjustable (default minimum duration is 3000 ms).
- Toasts can also be dismissed by clicking on a close button in the top-right corner.

## Variants

<Story id="notification-notificationtoast--variants" />

### Info

Use the 'Info' variant for informational, neutral messages.

### Confirm

Use the 'Confirm' variant the successful messages.

### Notify

Use the 'Notify' variant for warning messages, and other information a user should be aware of.

### Alert

Use the 'Alert' variant for error messages.

## Usage in code

First, wrap your application in the `ToastProvider` which keeps track of the open toasts and ensures the accessibility of the toast.

```tsx
// _app.tsx for Next.js or App.js for CRA
import { ToastProvider } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

export default function App() {
  return <ToastProvider>{/* Your content goes here... */}</ToastProvider>;
}
```

Then, use the `useNotificationToast` hook to open a toast from a component:

```tsx
import { useNotificationToast, Button } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

export function App({}) {
  const { setToast } = useNotificationToast();

  const handleClick = () => {
    setToast({
      body: 'This is a toast message',
    });
  };

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Open toast</Button>;
}
```

## Accessibility

By their nature as small quick messages, or interruptions, toasts map to [live regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).
Live region must always exist on the page at render, before the toast is generated.

Ideally, the toast messages should not contain any interactive elements.
The screen readers are gonna announce the raw text within toast messages, without structure and any need to move the user's focus.
Keyboard users won’t be able to move to the interactive elements with a clear path.
For example, there is a toast message with the text “You successfully updated your data.”, followed by a link or button with the text "Back".
Screen readers are gonna communicate a message as “You successfully updated your data. Back.”, and the semantics of the link "Back" is not announced.

To match the content, the role and aria-live level is adapted. The role is set to `"status"`, and it has `aria-live="polite"` meaning the screen reader will wait before announcing the update.

### Best practices

This component adheres to the following principles from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):

#### Toast duration

The auto-dimiss duration of the toast is adjustable.
Based on how fast the average American reads, a good lenght of time to keep the toast message up is 5 seconds plus 1 extra second for every 120 words.
The shortest default that should be used as a best practice is 6 seconds.

#### Consistent identification

Based on the WCAG guideline [3.2.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-identification.html) each component should be consistent with another.

#### Location

Following consistent identificaton, toast messages should be also placed consistently. Generally toast messages usually appear at the start or end of the DOM. If you place them somewhere else, it can cause difficulties for screen reader users to locate them.

#### Keyboard access and focus order

For any interactive element, user should be able to tab and shift through them by using the keyboard, which means they require a keyboard focus indicator.
Follow more in the WCAG guideline [2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)

Using the keyboard, if the toast message has any interactive elements, then it should always show up in the same place in the focus order, in a way that makes sense to a user.
This is related to the WCAG guideline [2.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html).
