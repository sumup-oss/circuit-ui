# DateInput

<Status variant="stable" />

The DateInput component allows user to type or select a specific date. The input value is always a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

## Usage

Use the component whenever asking for a specific individual date such as a birth date, expiry date, or appointment date.

For selecting a range of dates, we expect to introduce an iteration of this component in the future. Until then, we recommend using a combination of two input fields (one for the start and the other for the end date).

## Validations

TODO: Decide on built-in validation.

Use the `validationHint` to communicate the expected response to users.

### Invalid

The user needs to change the value to proceed. This could be due to a

### Warning

The user is recommended to change the value, but can proceed without doing so. Use it when the provided value could have unintended side-effects, such as a date in the far future.

### Valid

The user is reassured that the value is valid. Use sparingly.

## Optional

Use the `optionalLabel` prop to indicate that the field is optional. This can help reduce the cognitive load for the user by clearly indicating which fields are required and which are not. This label is only displayed when the `required` prop is falsy.

<Story of={Stories.Optional} />

## Readonly

Use the `readOnly` prop to indicate that the field is not currently editable. This can be useful in situations where the user needs to view but not edit the date, such as in a summary or review screen.
