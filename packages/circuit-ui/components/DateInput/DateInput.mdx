<Status variant="stable" />

<Story of={Stories.Base} />
<Props />

- can't use `input[type="date"]` because of accessibility issues and lack of customization
- date range selection
- closing the popover after date selection
- free-form input
- autocomplete
- context on mobile dialog: field name (and current value?)
- abstract away dialog? -> leave for later once re-implementing the Modal components
