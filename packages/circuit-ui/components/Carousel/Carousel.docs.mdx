## Browser Support

Carousel component supports all popular browsers, however [`object-fit` polyfill](https://github.com/constancecchen/object-fit-polyfill) is required for older browsers, such as Internet Explorer (all versions), Edge (versions `<= 18`) or old Android webviews (versions `<= 4.4`), to properly display slide images.
