# ButtonGroup

<Status.Stable />

The ButtonGroup component groups and formats two buttons. It adds spacing between buttons and handles responsiveness.

<Story id="components-button-buttongroup--base" />

<Props />

## Component variations

By default, buttons passed to the ButtonGroup will be centered. Use the `align` prop to align the buttons to the left or to the right on large screens. This has no effect on small screens.

## Accessibility

All accessibility considerations for the [`Button` component](Components/Button) also apply to the `ButtonGroup`.
