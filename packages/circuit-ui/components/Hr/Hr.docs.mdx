# HR

<Status.Stable />

HR provides a visual line that separates content into sections

<Story id="components-hr--base" />
<Props />

## When to use it

Use it when you need to separate different sections of a certain content within a body text or a list of data within a card.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** proper space the HR from the sections to make sure the division is clear
- **Do not** use HR to separate totally different content, it is used to break sections on a related content
