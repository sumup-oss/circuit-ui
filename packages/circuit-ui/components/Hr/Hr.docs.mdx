import { Status, Props, Story } from '../../../../.storybook/components';

# Hr

<Status.Stable />

A horizontal rule visually and semantically separates content into sections.

<Story id="components-hr--base" />
<Props />

## When to use it

Use it when you need to separate different sections of content within body copy or a list of data within a card.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** properly space the HR from the sections to make sure the division is clear
- **Do not** use HR to separate totally different content, it is used to break sections of related content
