# Calendar

<Status variant="legacy">Due to be replaced entirely.</Status>

A calendar contains a view with actionable buttons in order to pick a range of dates
and time frames for a specific task.

## Dependencies

The calendar components depend on [`react-dates`](https://github.com/react-dates/react-dates) and [`moment`](https://momentjs.com/) which are no longer included in Circuit UI. Install them manually before using the components:

```bash
# npm
npm install react-dates@^21.8 moment@^2.29
# yarn v1
yarn add react-dates@^21.8 moment@^2.29
```

Note that `react-dates` isn't compatible with React 18 yet ([ref](https://github.com/react-dates/react-dates/issues/2199)) and might cause a peer dependency error when using npm. Override the warning with `npm install --force` at your own risk.

## When to use it

Calendars are used when we need our users to pick a specific time period in order to complete a task
or filter a subset of dated items (such as the transaction history, for example).

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** suggest frequently used selections, such as "Today", "Last month", and others.
- **Do** use the proper component variation depending on how you need the data input
- **Do not** use it when requiring dates very far from the present, such as a birth date.

## Component variations

### Range Picker

<Status variant="legacy" />

Used when the user needs to have clear visibility of selected start and end dates after the selection,
for instance when a user needs to pick a time period within a form.
