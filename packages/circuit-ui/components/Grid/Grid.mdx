## Static columns

Sometimes you need the same type of grid behavior on all viewports. For that
scenario, you can use the normal `span` attribute of the grid.

<Story of={Stories.StaticColumns} />

## Responsive columns

You can use the following [breakpoints](Features/Theme/Docs) to define the
responsive behavior of your grid:

- `untilKilo`
- `kilo`
- `mega`
- `giga`
- `tera`

<Story of={Stories.ResponsiveColumns} />

Default refers to the smallest viewpoint.

## Skipping columns

Sometimes you want to skip a column. For that, you can use the `skip` prop on
the `Col` component.

<Story of={Stories.SkippingColumns} />

## Responsive skipping

<Story of={Stories.ResponsiveSkipping} />
