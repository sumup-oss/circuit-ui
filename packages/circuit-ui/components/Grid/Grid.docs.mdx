# Grid

<Status.Stable />

The grid provided by Circuit UI is a float-based grid. We use
this grid in applications where we need to support older browsers, such as Android and iOS webviews.

The [static CSS](Features/Static-CSS) does not include a grid system.

## Static columns

Sometimes you need the same type of grid behavior on all viewports. For that
scenario, you can use the normal `span` attribute of the grid.

<Story id="layout-grid-grid--static-columns" />

## Responsive columns

You can use the following [breakpoints](Features/Theme) to define the
responsive behavior of your grid:

- `untilKilo`
- `kilo`
- `mega`
- `giga`
- `tera`

<Story id="layout-grid-grid--responsive-columns" />

Default refers to the smallest viewpoint.

## Skipping columns

Sometimes you want to skip a column. For that, you can use the `skip` prop on
the `Col` component.

<Story id="layout-grid-grid--skipping-columns" />

## Responsive skipping

<Story id="layout-grid-grid--responsive-skipping" />
