import { Status, Story } from '../../../../.storybook/components';

# useClickOutside()

<Status.Stable />

Calls a function when clicking outside an element.

<Story id="hooks-useclickoutside--example" />

```ts
function useClickOutside(
  ref: RefObject<HTMLElement>,
  callback: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void,
  active = true,
): void;
```

## Usage

Application menus, modals, and other components with an "open" state should be dismissable by clicking outside. Whenever possible, use standard Circuit UI components since they have this and other accessibility features built-in by default.

In the rare case when you need to build a custom component, you can use this hook to enable users to dismiss it by clicking outside. The hook's event listener can be deactivated when the component isn't active (i.e. closed) to improve performance.
