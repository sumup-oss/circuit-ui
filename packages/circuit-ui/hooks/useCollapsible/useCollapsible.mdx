import { Meta, Status, Story } from '../../../../.storybook/components';
import * as Stories from './useCollapsible.stories';

<Meta of={Stories} />

# useCollapsible()

<Status.Stable />

A hook to build accessible and smoothly animated [collapsible sections](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/).

<Story of={Stories.Example} />

```ts
function useCollapsible({
  initialOpen?: boolean;
  duration?: number;
  id?: string;
}): {
  isOpen: boolean;
  toggleOpen: () => void;
  getButtonProps: (props?: { onClick?: (event: MouseEvent | KeyboardEvent) => void; }) => ButtonProps;
  getContentProps: (props?: { style?: Record<string, string>; }) => ContentProps;
};
```

## Usage

Collapsible sections are a common interaction pattern on the web. They let users toggle the visibility of content by clicking that content's label.

This hook provides the basic building blocks to build such a component. It returns [prop getters](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters) for the content and content label which ensures an accessible and smooth user experience. Refer to [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/) by Heydon Pickering for detailed instructions on how to build a collapsible section component.
