import { Meta, Status, Story } from '../../../../.storybook/components';
import * as Stories from './useFocusList.stories';

<Meta of={Stories} />

# useFocusList()

<Status.Stable />

Enables keyboard navigation for a list of focusable elements.

<Story of={Stories.Example} />

```ts
function useFocusList(): {
  'data-focus-list': string;
  'onKeyDown': (event: KeyboardEvent) => void;
};
```

## Usage

Application menus such as popover menus, custom select dropdowns, and navigation lists should be [navigatable by keyboard](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/#keyboardandfocusbehavior). Whenever possible, use standard Circuit UI components since they have keyboard support and other accessibility features built-in by default.

In the rare case when you need to build a custom application menu, you should use this hook to enable users to navigate between menu items using the arrow up/down keys.

Note that this hook only covers one part of (keyboard) accessibility. For example, it does not manage focus when opening/closing a menu. Research and implement additional keyboard support as necessary for your specific component.
