<Story id="hooks-usefocuslist--example" />

```ts
useFocusList(): {
  'data-focus-list': string;
  'onKeyDown': (event: KeyboardEvent) => void;
};
```

## Usage

Application menus such as popover menus, custom select dropdowns, and navigation lists should be [navigatable by keyboard](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/#keyboardandfocusbehavior). This hook enables users to navigate between menu items using the arrow up/down keys. It does not manage focus when opening/closing a menu, make sure to implement this as well.
