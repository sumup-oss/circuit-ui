# dialog-polyfill

This code was copied from [GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill), specifically [GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill#231](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill/pull/231), which adds support for safely importing the polyfill in isomorphic environments.
