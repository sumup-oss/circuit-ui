This code was copied from [s-yadav/react-number-format](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format), specifically [v5.2.2](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format/tree/v5.2.2), the version before a bug was introduced that breaks controlled inputs for locales that use `.` as the thousand separator.
