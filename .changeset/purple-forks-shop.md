Added the `CheckboxGroup` component. The `options` prop specifies how the Checkboxes are rendered. Each option in the `options` prop must have a `value` key and a `label` key. The `value` prop indicates which Checkboxes are checked by default. The `validationHint` for the individual Checkboxes are disallowed in favor of a single `validationHint` for the `CheckboxGroup`.
