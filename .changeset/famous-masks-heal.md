Added the `--cui-fg-on-strong-subtle`, `--cui-fg-on-strong-subtle-hovered`, `--cui-fg-on-strong-subtle-pressed`, and `--cui-fg-on-strong-subtle-disabled` color tokens. Use them for secondary content that provides additional information on backgrounds ending with `-strong` in order to achieve the necessary contrast for accessibility.
