Changed the default font from Aktiv Grotesk to Inter, a variable font. Variable fonts combine a continuous range of weights and other "axes" into a single file. This speeds up page load times and enables more creative freedom. Inter is a close match to Aktiv Grotesk, so users shouldn't notice a difference.
