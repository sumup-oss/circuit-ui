**This package is now pure ESM**. Please [read this](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

- If you use TypeScript, you need to use TypeScript 4.7 or later ([ref](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46452)).
- If you use a bundler, make sure it supports ESM and that you have correctly configured it for ESM. (Next.js supports ESM packages out of the box since [v12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#es-modules-support-and-url-imports)).
