# Media queries

To use the media query utilities provided by Circuit themes, you'll use a
function provided by the theme called `theme.mq`.

## Usage in code

```javascript
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { css } from '@emotion/core';

const ResponsiveDiv = styled('div')(
  ({ theme }) => css`
    ${theme.mq.mega}
      padding-top: ${theme.spacings.peta};
    };
  `
);
```

## Breakpoints

You can use the following breakpoints when implementing either components
inside Circuit UI or writing code that should be theme-compliant in your app.

<MediaQueriesTable />

## Responsive best practices

- Do not refer directly to `theme.breakpoints`, but instead use the named
  media query helpers.
