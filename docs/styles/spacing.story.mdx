# Spacing

Spaces are the invisible skeleton of every UI. It should be used in a wise and sensible way.
With space components, you can create bounds and separate elements on the UI.
The space component can be used in vertical and horizontal order.

You can refer to a spacing from the theme using `theme.spacings.<SIZE>`.

<Spacing spacingName="bit"/>
<Spacing spacingName="byte"/>
<Spacing spacingName="kilo"/>
<Spacing spacingName="mega"/>
<Spacing spacingName="giga"/>
<Spacing spacingName="tera"/>
<Spacing spacingName="peta"/>
<Spacing spacingName="exa"/>
<Spacing spacingName="zetta"/>

## When to use it

Use it when you want to create a relationship with the level of the spacing used on a page.
You can create a close association between elements by using less space and vice versa.
Organized space patterns can help you not use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.

You can also create a hierarchy with spacing by setting more space around elements will give them higher importance than the components with less space around them. Example H1 have more margins than H2.
As the headers descend in size, the spaces have to follow them.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** grant high importance to an UI element by giving it extra surrounding space. That way it will attract more focus.
- **Do** use white space as a way to let user's eye to rest.
- **Do** use spaces that can be evenly divided by 4
- **Do not** clutter the UI. Pay attention when you have to display big chunks of information. Dense pages are disorienting and frustrating for our users.
- **Do not** use percentages for padding and margin.

## Usage in code

```javascript
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { css } from '@emotion/core';

const Box = styled('div')`
  ${({ theme }) => css`
    padding: ${theme.spacings.kilo};
    margin-bottom: ${theme.spacings.mega};
  `};
`;
```

**Tip:** If you get an error like `Cannot read property "spacings" of undefined`, be sure you have correctly
configured your theme at the root. Read the
[Getting started](Introduction|Developers) guide for more.

### Best practices

**Do use spacings for:**

- Margins and paddings

**Don't use spacings for:**

- Border width. Instead use `theme.borderWidth.<SIZE>`.
- Border radius. Instead use `theme.borderRadius.<SIZE>`.
- Icon size. Instead use `theme.iconSizes.<SIZE>`.
- Font size or line height. Instead, see [Typography](Styles|Typography).
