# Release Process

Circuit UI follows semantic versioning. In short, this means we use patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for breaking changes.

## Changesets

Circuit UI uses [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to do versioning. A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds three bits of information:

- What needs to be released
- What version the packages should be released at (using a [semver bump type](https://semver.org/))
- A changelog entry for the released packages

Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md#i-am-in-a-multi-package-repository-a-mono-repo) for more information.

## Release branches

We have a couple of special branches that are used for stable releases and prereleases.

- **`main`** - The code in the `main` branch is stable and production-tested. When a PR is merged to `main` that contains a new changeset, `changesets` opens a PR and keeps it up to date with the latest changes. When the PR is merged, a new version is automatically published to NPM and the changesets since the last release are added to CHANGELOG.md files in GitHub.
- **`canary`** - This is a branch you can use to publish a prerelease version if you need to deploy the changes somewhere to test them. `canary` is a throw-away branch that can be recreated from `main` at any time. **Hint**: If you only need to test your changes locally, you can use `yarn add ./path-to-circuit-ui` to link the development version.
- **`next`** â€” This branch is used to develop the next major version in parallel. It is the only branch that can contain breaking changes.

To install the most recent version from a release channel in your project, run:

```bash
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui@<release-channel>
```

### Prereleases

Prereleases can be done for either the `next` or the `canary` release channels.

To publish a prerelease version, check out on the branch for your release channel and run the changesets `pre enter` command:

```bash
git checkout next # or `canary`
yarn changeset pre enter next # or `canary`
```

This will generate a `pre.json` file in the `.changeset` directory.

Push it to the branch, then verify and merge the changesets `Version Packages` PR for your release channel. Changesets will publish the prerelease version in the CI.
