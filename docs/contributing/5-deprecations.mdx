# Deprecations

The purpose of deprecating a component or a feature is to warn people that it should not be used anymore, and that support will be removed in the future. You can either offer a preferred solution, or it may be that the feature is no longer needed.

1. **Communicate intent to deprecate.** Please open an issue in the repo. (_For SumUp employees_) Go through the product repos and find instances of the component in use, and proactively communicate with the teams responsible for those features. Give your reasoning about _why_ you believe the feature should be deprecated, and discuss the impact on the teams that rely on that feature today.
2. **Decide on a timeline.** Based on the feedback you receive, come up with a timeline, including the people who are affected by the change. Generally speaking, 3-6 months is ample time. Document the planned date of removal in the original deprecation issue.
3. **Add a notice to the docs and to the code.** Introduce the deprecation warning in a minor release. Change the status badge on the component page to "Deprecated" and add a `deprecate('Feature has been deprecated and will be removed in version X.0.0')` to the `render()` function of the component, or generally on the first run of an instance of a component or feature.
4. **Wait for the deadline.** You may still need to fix critical bugs during the deprecation period, but we should try and offer alternatives where possible.
5. **Communicate it one more time!** Give one last warning to people involved that the deadline is imminent.
6. **Delete it.** Create a pull request deleting the deprecated functionality, which should signal a major version bump.

In some cases, you can also introduce a completely new version of the component alongside the old, especially in cases where teams need longer to migrate to the new component.
