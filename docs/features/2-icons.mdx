# Icons

<Intro>

The icons used throughout Circuit UI come from SumUp's icon library, [`@sumup-oss/icons`](Packages/icons/Docs), which is a required peer dependency of `@sumup-oss/circuit-ui`. Refer to its [documentation](Packages/icons/Docs) for usage instructions and the [contribution guidelines](Contributing/Contributing-Icons/Docs) to contribute new icons.
