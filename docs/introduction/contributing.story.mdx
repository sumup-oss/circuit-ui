# How to contribute

<Intro>
  Thank you for making the effort to improve Circuit UI! There are multiple ways
  to contribute: report a bug, suggest an improvement, propose a new component
  or become a core contributor. Here's how.
</Intro>

**In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we expect all participants to read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](Introduction|Code-of-Conduct).**

## Filing an issue

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/issues) to track all our bugs and feature requests. When [submitting a new issue](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/issues/new/choose), please check that it hasn't already been raised by someone else. We've provided templates for new issues which will help you to structure your issue to ensure it can be picked up and actioned easily.

## Proposing a change

Our process for introducing changes to Circuit UI largely follow the [Vanilla design system](https://vanillaframework.io/) process published by Canonical.

### Adapting an existing component

- You may open a pull request with your proposed changes without opening an issue in Circuit UI, so long as those changes could be classified as minor.

### Creating new components

- You should favor using existing components rather than creating new ones.
- You should favor adapting existing components rather than creating new ones.
- You must contribute new components through the design system (rather than coding them directly in the application) if the component is likely to be used in more than one project.
- You should [create an issue](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/issues/new/choose) in the Circuit UI GitHub repo with the proposed components using the appropriate issue type, _before_ implementing the component.
- You should _not_ contribute components that are highly specific to the use-case of a single application. If possibly, generalize it!

### Deprecating a component

The purpose of deprecating a component or a feature is to warn people that it should not be used anymore, and that support will be removed in the future. You can either offer a preferred solution, or it may be that the feature is no longer needed.

1. **Communicate intent to deprecate.** Please open an issue in the repo. (_For SumUp employees_) Go through the product repos and find instances of the component in use, and proactively communicate with the teams responsible for those features. Give your reasoning about _why_ you believe the feature should be deprecated, and discuss the impact on the teams that rely on that feature today.
2. **Decide on a timeline.** Based on the feedback you receive, come up with a timeline, including the people who are affected by the change. Generally speaking, 3-6 months is ample time. Document the planned date of removal in the original deprecation issue.
3. **Add a notice to the docs and to the code.** Introduce the deprecation warning in a minor release. Change the status badge on the component page to "Deprecated" and add a `deprecate(`ComponentName has been deprecated and will be removed in version X.0.0`)` to the `render()` function of the component, or generally on the first run of an instance of a component or feature.
4. **Wait for the deadline.** You may still need to fix critical bugs during the deprecation period, but we should try and offer alternatives where possible.
5. **Communicate it one more time!** Give one last warning to people involved that the deadline is imminent.
6. **Delete it.** Create a pull request deleting the deprecated functionality, which should signal a major version bump.

In some cases, you can also introduce a completely new version of the component alongside the old, especially in cases where teams need longer to migrate to the new component.

### Review process

- Either a designer or a developer must open the issue in Circuit UI to propose a new component or changes to an existing component.
- New components must be reviewed by two designers and two developers from different teams.
- We should strive to decide whether we adopt a new component, if it's needed for a feature, within one week of opening the issue.
- We should strive to decide whether we accept changes to an existing component within one week of opening the issue.

## Development workflow

To work on an issue, please [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and create a new branch on your local fork. When you're happy and would like to propose that changeset to be merged back upstream, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to merge from your local `origin/master` to `upstream/master`.

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder in your terminal. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a sandbox to build UI components in isolation. To start running Storybook on your local machine, run:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to unit test our components. Since most components are purely visual, we rely a lot on snapshot tests. Business logic should be tested with more specific assertions. To start unit tests in watch mode, run:

```bash
yarn test:unit:watch
```

As for linting and formatting, you can configure your editor to automatically lint and format your code on save. For this purpose, we're using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). If you need to do it manually, you can run:

```bash
yarn test:lint
# Automatically fix (some) issues
yarn test:lint:fix
```

While making changes to Circuit UI, you might want to test them in your application. You can do so by [linking the two projects](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) locally.

```bash
# Inside the Circuit UI project folder, run:
yarn link
# Then, in your application project folder, run:
yarn link @sumup/circuit-ui
```

## Development Principles

When developing components in Circuit UI, we have a few development principles
you should keep in mind. They will help you with picking good names, design
clear and understandable APIs, and keep things consistent.

### Naming principles

**Use obvious and transparent naming.** Our components should use names that
are as standard as possible. Opt for a more verbose name rather than a creative
or clever one. When in doubt, you can look at several other component libraries
for inspiration.

**Opt for one- or two-word component and prop names.** When possible, stay
concise as long as you can remain clear as well.

**Handlers should be written as `onVerb`.** Or (if needed) `onVerbNoun` rather
than `onNounVerb`. For example, if you cannot reasonably name your event
handler `onSelect` because it is overly vague for your use-case, instead opt
for something like `onSelectFruit` rather than `onFruitSelect`.

If at all possible, stick to standard names you'd find in the DOM or React APIs like
`onClick`. This helps make our APIs more predictable!

```javascript
// Do: Use standard component names and short prop names
<DatePicker onClick={fn} nextButton="Next" prevButton="Previous" />

// Don't: Come up with unusual component names or name handlers without the `on` prefix
<CustomDatePicker selectDate={fn} />
```

### Component design principles

**Keep the API small.** As much as possible, avoid exposing too many options for configuring a component. The exception is if you are wrapping an existing third-party library, you may have a good reason to simply pass along all additional props to ensure API compatibility with that third-party library.

### Best practices

**Every component must be thoroughly tested.** If the component is purely representative (e.g. simple, styled components), a snapshot test is sufficient. If the component is interactive, you should do your best to test the interaction on a unit level.

**Ensure accessibility and autocompletion.** Every component should have a minimum of an accessibility test asserted with jest-axe. You should also make a special effort to properly enable autocompletion for relevant fields, using the proper input names and autocomplete properties.

**All translated text should be provided as props with English defaults.** It must be possible for all user-facing text inside a component to be replaced with translated versions. This also makes it easier to stick to content guidelines by providing a good starting example.

**Documentation is part of your component.** Be sure to write meaningful documentation about best practices / usage guidelines when creating or updating existing components. You can even use existing documentation for reference.

## Releasing

Circuit UI follows semantic versioning. In short, this means we use patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for breaking changes. Our release process is automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) which adheres to the [conventional commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

We have a couple of special branches that are automatically released whenever
you merge code into them.

- **`beta`** — This is a branch you can use to test your changes integrated with other branches before it is ready to be PR'd to `canary`. It is also useful if you need to deploy the changes somewhere to test them. `beta` is a throw-away branch that can be recreated from `canary` at any time.
- **`canary`** - The step before `master`. This is where we prepare a group of changes for the next release. Code on `canary` should be tested and stable. Usually, `canary` is a couple of commits ahead of `master`.
- **`master`** - A merge to `master` will release a new version of the library. Code on `master` is stable and production-tested.
- **`next`** - This branch is used to develop the next major version in parallel. It is the only branch that can contain breaking changes.

When you merge into one of these release branches, `semantic-release` runs in CI and automatically:

1. Pushes a new version to the respective release channel on NPM (`beta`, `canary`, `latest` or `next`)
2. Updates the release notes on GitHub based on the commit messages since the previous release
3. ...and posts comments on any PRs and issues that are included in the release.

To install the most recent version from a release channel, run:

```bash
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui@<release-channel>
```

### Troubleshooting

- **The release failed.** This can happen if you merge multiple times to a release branch in short succession. The first CI job will fail because the branch on GitHub is ahead of the branch that was checked out in CI. `semantic-release` will open an issue to alert you of the failure. You can simply wait for the last CI job to finish. It should succeed and will automatically close the issue.
- **My commit doesn't show in the release notes.** Make sure that your commit message follows the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). Otherwise, `semantic-release` can't understand your commit and will omit it.
