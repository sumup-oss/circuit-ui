# Design principles

<Intro>
  When developing a common design language, is important to remind us why we are
  here in the first place. Our mission is to design simple yet beautiful
  solutions, which cater to real life problems by partnering with our users so
  that they can spend more time doing what they love. In order to do that, we
  developed a set of principles that help us always be on that path.
</Intro>

**Problem Focus.** We don't create new features, we solve real life problems. We strive to
understand the problems of our users before focusing on the interface, involving them
early and often to validate or disprove our hypotheses. We tailor our products to their
everyday tasks without getting attached to our own ideas.

**Universal Empathy.** At the centre of every design decision are our users as we aim to build
products that satisfy their needs. Open communication with our customer and constant research
helps us in understanding their needs and allows us to improve the ways in which their business
can be run and to alleviate their many pain-points. As we serve a broad range of global users
with differing problems, goals and measurements of success, we must never forget to think in an
inclusive way, optimising for individual use-cases and edge-cases.

**Predictable Simplicity.** The products and features we develop should feel familiar to a user
using our platform for the first time. Creating products and features that maintain a sense of
predictability means our products are easier to understand and use from the outset.
We don't introduce new UI patterns, we utilize robust, useful and usable UI patterns and
interactions with proven track records of working well in consumer grade applications

# Spacing

Spaces are the invisible skeleton of every UI. It should be used in a wise and sensible way.
With space components, you can create bounds and separate elements on the UI.
The space component can be used in vertical and horizontal order.

## When to use it

Use it when you want to create a relationship with the level of the spacing used on a page.
You can create a close association between elements by using less space and vice versa.
Organized space patterns can help you not use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.

You can also create a hierarchy with spacing by setting more space around elements will give them higher importance than the components with less space around them. Example H1 have more margins than H2.
As the headers descend in size, the spaces have to follow them.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** grant high importance to an UI element by giving it extra surrounding space. That way it will attract more focus.
- **Do** use white space as a way to let user's eye to rest.
- **Do** use spaces that can be evenly divided by 4
- **Do not** clutter the UI. Pay attention when you have to display big chunks of information. Dense pages are disorienting and frustrating for our users.
- **Do not** use percentages for padding and margin.

## Contributing

Before starting, make sure you review our design principles and the components section. In that way, you will
familiarize with the available components that you can leverage when solving a particular problem.

### Using Figma

In our day to day work at SumUp, we use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design and develop Circuit. There, we keep our updated
libraries that make our workflow faster and ensures consistency across files.

#### Shared libraries

**Atoms Library.** All the core visual elements and components. Here you can quickly add to your designs all the
components currently available at Circuit.

**Styles Library.** Where colors and text styles are concentrated. There you can find all the available product and brand color schemes,
with their particular hex and Pantone codes.

**Currents Library.** Our icon library. Here we keep iconography guidelines and all of our icons divided by categories.

_As of today, Figma doesn't support public libraries. We are working to find a way to share ours with anyone
thinking of contributing to Circuit._

#### Best practices

- Make sure that every time you add a component to your file you pull it as a symbol from the Atom library.
- Only use text and colors that exist on the Styles library. Figma allows you to select these styles directly on
  the text and color selectors.
- When introducing changes to a library, make sure to always publish a new version and document what has changed.
