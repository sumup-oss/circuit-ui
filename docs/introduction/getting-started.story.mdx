# Getting Started

<Intro>
  The instructions below cover how to use Circuit UI with a React application.
  If you'd like to use the Circuit UI styles without React, read the{' '}

## Creating a new app with Circuit UI

Starting fresh? The quickest way to bootstrap a new project with Circuit UI is using [`create-sumup-react-app`](https://github.com/sumup/create-sumup-react-app). It will create a new project based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and will add Circuit UI and SumUp's [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup/foundry) JavaScript toolkit.

### Prerequisites

- You should have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v9.10+** installed
- This project requires **[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/)** to be installed on your system. Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript. You can read how to install the Yarn CLI in [their documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
- You will need **`npx`** installed. It is bundled with `npm` v5.2 and up. Alternatively, you can run `yarn global add npx` or `npm install -g npx` to manually install it.

### Installation

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to place your project in. Then run the following command where `my-app` is the name of your project:

```bash
yarn create @sumup/sumup-react-app my-app
# Or if you prefer npx:
npx @sumup/create-sumup-react-app my-app
```

This will create the folder `my-app` and initialize a new project inside.

## Adding Circuit UI to an existing app

Already have a project? You can install Circuit UI via `yarn` or `npm`. In your current project directory, run the following command:

```bash
# With yarn:
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui
# With npm:
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui
```

Circuit UI relies on some mandatory peer dependencies, namely [@sumup/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/icons), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). You should install them with the following command:

```bash
# With yarn:
yarn add @sumup/icons react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# With npm:
npm install @sumup/icons react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

### Configuring the theme

Finally, you need to make the theme available to Circuit UI. SumUp's default themes are part of the [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens) package. In most cases, they should cover your needs. Refer to the [Theme documentation](Advanced|Theme) to learn how to use and customize the theme.  

At the root of your application, wrap the components in the `ThemeProvider` from Emotion:


```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { light } from '@sumup/design-tokens';
import { Button } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={light}>
    <Button primary>Click me</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```
