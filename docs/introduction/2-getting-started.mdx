## Creating a new app with Circuit UI

Starting fresh? The best way to bootstrap a new project with Circuit UI is to use our [`Next.js template`](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/tree/main/packages/cna-template).

It will get generate a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with Circuit UI and SumUp's [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup-oss/foundry) frontend toolkit, and get you started in minutes!

## Adding Circuit UI to an existing app

Already have a project? You can install Circuit UI via `npm` or `yarn`. In your current project directory, run the following command:

```sh
# With npm:
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui

# With yarn v1
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui
```

Circuit UI relies on some mandatory peer dependencies, namely [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens), [@sumup/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/icons), [@sumup/intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/intl), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). You should install them with the following command:

```sh
# With npm:
npm install --save @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons @sumup/intl react react-dom @emotion/react @emotion/styled
# With yarn v1
yarn add @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons @sumup/intl react react-dom @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

We also recommend installing and configuring the [`@sumup/eslint-plugin-circuit-ui`](Packages/eslint-plugin-circuit-ui/Docs) ESLint plugin. It will lint [Circuit UI custom properties](Features/Theme/Docs) and will include codemods for future Circuit UI breaking changes.

### Configuring the theme

SumUp's default themes are part of the [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens) package. In most cases, they should cover your needs. Refer to the [Theme documentation](Features/Theme/Docs) to learn how to use and customize the theme.

To make the theme available to Circuit UI, import the global styles (`@sumup/circuit-ui/styles.css`) and wrap the root of your application in the `ThemeProvider` from Emotion:

```tsx
// _app.tsx for Next.js or App.js for CRA
import '@sumup/circuit-ui/styles.css';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { light } from '@sumup/design-tokens';

export default function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={light}>{/* Your app */}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

#### Typing the theme

If you're using TypeScript, you might run into type conflicts when using the `theme` prop:

```
Type 'Theme' is not assignable to type 'ThemeArgs'.ts(2322)
```

Type the theme by extending the `@emotion/react` module declaration, for example in a new `types/emotion.d.ts` file (make sure the file is included in `typeRoots` in your `tsconfig.json`):

```ts
// types/emotion.d.ts
import { Theme as CircuitTheme } from '@sumup/design-tokens';
import {} from '@emotion/react/types/css-prop'; // See https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/1941

declare module '@emotion/react' {
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
  export interface Theme extends CircuitTheme {}
}
```

This will also enable Intellisense for the theme object.

For more information, refer to [Emotion's TypeScript documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/typescript#define-a-theme).

### Configuring the viewport

Finally, make sure that the viewport meta tag includes `viewport-fit=cover`, and that your app has the right padding to render inside [CSS safe areas](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env()>):

```tsx
// _app.tsx for Next.js or App.js for CRA
import '@sumup/circuit-ui/styles.css';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { light } from '@sumup/design-tokens';
import Head from 'next/head'; // Add the meta tag directly in index.html with CRA

const Layout = css`
  padding: env(safe-area-inset-top) env(safe-area-inset-right) env(
      safe-area-inset-bottom
    ) env(safe-area-inset-left);
`;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={light}>
      <Head>
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover"
        />
      </Head>
      <Layout>{/* Your app */}</Layout>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
