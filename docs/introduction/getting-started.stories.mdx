# Getting Started

<Intro>
  The instructions below cover how to use Circuit UI with a React application.
  If you'd like to use the Circuit UI styles without React, read the{' '}

## Creating a new app with Circuit UI

Starting fresh? The quickest way to bootstrap a new project with Circuit UI is using one of our starter templates:

- **[create-sumup-next-app](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/tree/main/packages/create-sumup-next-app)** — bootstrap a fresh [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with Circuit UI and SumUp's [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup-oss/foundry) frontend toolkit
- **[create-sumup-react-app](https://github.com/sumup-oss/circuit-ui/tree/main/packages/create-sumup-react-app)** — bootstrap a new React app with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), Circuit UI, and SumUp's [Foundry](https://github.com/sumup-oss/foundry) frontend toolkit

## Adding Circuit UI to an existing app

Already have a project? You can install Circuit UI via `yarn` or `npm`. In your current project directory, run the following command:

```bash
# With yarn:
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui
# With npm:
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui
```

Circuit UI relies on some mandatory peer dependencies, namely [@sumup/collector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/collector), [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens), [@sumup/icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/icons), [@sumup/intl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/intl), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/). You should install them with the following command:

```sh
# With yarn:
yarn add @sumup/collector @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# With npm:
npm install --save @sumup/collector @sumup/design-tokens @sumup/icons react react-dom @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

### Configuring the theme

Finally, you need to make the theme available to Circuit UI. SumUp's default themes are part of the [@sumup/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/design-tokens) package. In most cases, they should cover your needs. Refer to the [Theme documentation](Features/Theme) to learn how to use and customize the theme.

At the root of your application, wrap the components in the `ThemeProvider` from Emotion and add the `BaseStyles` component:

```tsx
// _app.tsx for Next.js or App.js for CRA
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { light } from '@sumup/design-tokens';
import { BaseStyles } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={light}>
      <BaseStyles />
      {/* Your content here... */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
