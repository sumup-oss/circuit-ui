# Static CSS

<Status.Experimental/><Status.Description>This has not been tested in production. Use with caution.</Status.Description>

<Intro>
  Projects that can't or don't use React can still benefit from Circuit UI. They
  can use the styles by extracting the plain CSS from the components.

## Generating a stylesheet

Circuit UI offers a CLI to generate a stylesheet that is tailored to your project. Below is an overview of the available options:

```sh
$ yarn static-styles --help

Usage:
  --theme             The name of the theme to use.
                                      [options: "circuit"] [default: "circuit"]
  --components        A comma separated list of the components to include.
                      Also supports "all" or "none".
                                                       [array] [default: "all"]
  --global            Whether to include global styles.
                                                     [boolean] [default: false]
  --customProperties  Whether to use CSS custom properties (variables).
                                                     [boolean] [default: false]
  --pretty            Whether the CSS should be formatted with prettier.
                                                     [boolean] [default: false]
  --filePath          Path to the file where the stylesheet should be saved,
                      relative to the current directory.               [string]
  --help              Show help                                       [boolean]
  --version           Show the version                                [boolean]
```

A hosted version of a stylesheet with all supported components is available at https://circuit.sumup.com/static/circuit-ui-v1.css, however, we recommend generating a custom stylesheet with only the styles you need.

## Theming

At built time, when the styles are extracted to static CSS, any dynamic values are replaced by static values. That means that the theme values are hard-coded and cannot be changed with JavaScript at runtime.

In order to change the theme values at runtime you can use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). Pass the `--customProperties` flag to the CLI to generate the CSS with custom properties and add the root values to the global styles.

Be aware that custom properties are [only supported in Edge 16+](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables). Depending on your target user group, you should use a [polyfill](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill).
