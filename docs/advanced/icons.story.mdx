# Icons

The icons used throughout Circuit UI come from [SumUp's icon library](https://github.com/sumup-oss/icons). The [`@sumup/icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/icons) package is a required peer dependency of [`@sumup/circuit-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sumup/circuit-ui). You can install the package by running the following command in your project:

```bash
yarn add @sumup/icons
# Or if you prefer npm:
npm install @sumup/icons
```

<Icons />
