import { Playground } from 'docz'

import Button from '../../../src/components/Button/Button';

import PropTable from '../../utils/PropTable';
import {Wrapper} from '../../utils/Wrapper';

# Documenting a component
A component needs to have a basic description, prop table, and playground to showcase behavior. It's also a good idea to provide usage scenarios and include multiple playgrounds with different props.

## How To: PropTable
We have created a custom prop table component, which you can find in `docs/utils` folder. It requires a default exported component, so that `react-docgen` dependency can properly parse the PropTypes.

```javascript
 import OriginalButton from '../../../src/components/Button/Button';
 import PropTable from '../../utils/PropTable';

 <div>
 	<PropTable component={Button} />
 </div>
```
the result looks like this:

 <div>
 	<PropTable component={Button} />
 </div>

 ## How To: Playground

 The Playground component requires the button to be wrapped in ThemeProvider (this will change in the future). Therefore we create a `DocButton.js` file, where the component is wrapped in a ThemeProvider.

 ```javascript
import {Wrapper} from '../../utils/Wrapper';

# Button

<Playground wrapper={Wrapper}>
  	<Button primary>Button</Button>
</Playground>

 ```
the end result will look like:

<Playground wrapper={Wrapper}>
  	<Button primary>Button</Button>
</Playground>


## Known Issues with Docz
Docz is still relatively unstable (current version is 0.59), and there are some bugs that are getting fixed. Here is a list of bugs and workarounds we found for them.

### Document Order
The document ordering is complicated, and being currently worked on. See [this issue](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/143).
It's possible to achieve proper ordering with numbers, although we have not tested it yet.

### Slow Scrolling
In Safari there might be slower scrolling. Try using another browser or wait for a fix. See [this issue](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/122).
