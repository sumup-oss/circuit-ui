# Theming

A theme is comprised of the following elements:

- Colors
- Spacings
- Icon sizes
- Border radius
- Border width
- Typography (font size and line height pairings)
- Font stack
- Font weight
- Grid settings
- Breakpoints
- Transitions
- Z-indicies

In order to define a new theme, you should make a copy of the [default theme](https://github.com/sumup/circuit-ui/blob/master/src/themes/default.js).

Wondering how to access the theme from your components? Read [Getting started for Developers](/getting-started/developers).
