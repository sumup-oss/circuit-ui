## Theming

As the styles are extracted to static CSS, any dynamic values have to be replaced by static values at build time. By default, the theme values are hard-coded and cannot be changed with JavaScript at runtime.

In order to change the theme values at runtime you can use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) in the theme.

### Create a theme with custom properties

### Define the custom property values

1. can be generated from an existing theme
2. needs to come before all other global styles
3. can be overriden locally -> see MDN docs
