# Circuit Ui

Resources, tooling, and design guidelines for building websites with Circuit
UI, the web incarnation of the SumUp Circuit Design System. 

## Introduction

Our primary goal is to create a system that can be used to build a wide variety
of SumUp websites, while providing a consistent user experience to our end
users. In addition, the design system and component library should be
easy to use and developer and designer-friendly.

This style guide is living documentation that will be updated as we continue to
improve and evolve our design system.
