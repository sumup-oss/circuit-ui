# Designers

Before starting, make sure you review our design principles and the components section. In that way, you will 
familiarize with the available components that you can leverage when solving a particular problem.

## Using Figma

In our day to day work at SumUp, we use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design and develop Circuit. There, we keep our updated
libraries that make our workflow faster and ensures consistency across files.

### Shared libraries

**Atoms Library.** All the core visual elements and components. Here you can quickly add to your designs all the 
components currently available at Circuit.

**Styles Library.** Where colors and text styles are concentrated. There you can find all the available product and brand color schemes,
with their particular hex and Pantone codes.  

**Currents Library.** Our icon library. Here we keep iconography guidelines and all of our icons divided by categories.

*As of today, Figma doesn't support public libraries. We are working to find a way to share ours with anyone
thinking of contributing to Circuit.*

### Best practices
- Make sure that every time you add a component to your file you pull it as a symbol from the Atom library.
- Only use text and colors that exist on the Styles library. Figma allows you to select these styles directly on
the text and color selectors.
- When introducing changes to a library, make sure to always publish a new version and document what has changed.
