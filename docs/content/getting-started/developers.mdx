## Install

### Adding Circuit to an existing app

You can install Circuit via npm or yarn. It relies on
[emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and
[emotion-theming](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/emotion-theming) (as well as
React) being available in whatever project you are working on.

```bash
npm install @sumup/circuit-ui @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

```bash
yarn add @sumup/circuit-ui @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

### Creating a new app with Circuit

You can use [create-sumup-react-app](https://github.com/sumup/create-sumup-react-app) (powered by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) to scaffold out a new development-ready React app with Circuit built-in.

### Creating presentations with Circuit

You can create presentations with [circuit-deck](https://github.com/sumup/circuit-deck), a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) starter with Circuit built-in.

## Configuring the theme

At the root of your application, you should tell your app which theme to use.
In most cases, you will want to use the SumUp default theme.

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { Button, theme } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme.circuit}>
    <Button primary>Click me</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the `@sumup/circuit-ui` package, as demonstrated
above.

### Custom base components

Some of the low-level components that are used in Circuit UI can be overridden with custom components. This is useful e.g. when your application is using a custom router and needs to use a special `Link` component.

```javascript
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { ComponentsContext, Button } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const CustomLink = ({ to, ...rest }) => <Link href={to} {...rest} />;

const App = () => (
  <ComponentsContext.Provider value={{ Link: CustomLink }}>
    <Button href="/">Home</Button>
  </ComponentsContext.Provider>
);

export default App;
```

Using the context provider and specifying custom components is fully optional, Circuit will fall back to built-in components. You can also override only a subset of components, Circuit will merge them with the default components.

In order to access the base components in your own application you can use the `withComponents` higher-order component or the `useComponents` hook:

```javascript
import { useComponents, withComponents } from '@sumup/circuit-ui';

const Navigation = ({ links }) => {
  const { Link } = useComponents();
  return links.map(({ href, label }) => <Link href={href}>{label}</Link>);
};

const Logo = ({ components, companyName, companyUrl }) => {
  const { Link } = components;
  return <Link href={companyUrl}>{companyName}</Link>;
};

const FooterWithComponents = withComponents(Footer);
```

Below is an overview of the base components:

#### `Link`

Accepts the same props as the `<a>` HTML tag. If your custom component expects different props, you need to map them to the standard attributes (see the example above).
