# Developers

## Install

You can install Circuit via npm or yarn. Today we do not have a functioning
build for distribution, so you should install the latest release
from github by tag.

[See all releases on Github](https://github.com/sumup/circuit-ui/releases)

Circuit also uses [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and [emotion-theming](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion-theming).

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/sumup/circuit-ui.git#development-0.0.4 emotion react-emotion emotion-theming
```

```bash
yarn add git+https://github.com/sumup/circuit-ui.git#development-0.0.4 emotion react-emotion emotion-theming
```

## Configuring the theme

At the root of your application, you should tell your app which theme to use.
In most cases, you will want to use the SumUp default theme.

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming';
import { standard } from 'circuit-ui/themes';
import { Button } from 'circuit-ui';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={standard}>
    <Button primary>Click me</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the `circuit-ui` package, as demonstrated
above.

## Using helpers

There are a few helpers you may want to use within Circuit.

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply global styles to your page. Here is how you can do this with the utilities provided by Circuit UI.

```javascript
import { standard } from 'circuit-ui/themes';
import { globalStyles } from 'circuit-ui/styles';

const customStyles = `
  body {
    color: red;
  }
`;

globalStyles({ theme: standard, custom: customStyles });
```
