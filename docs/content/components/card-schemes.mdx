Card Schemes provides a quick way to pull all accepted card schemes icons from SumUp.

<Playground>

    iconIds={['mastercard', 'visa', 'ec', 'googlePay', 'applePay']}

## When to use it

Card scheme icons are used to indicate the accepted card schemes, such as in a credit card input form or in the marketing
website to promote accepted schemes.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always check which schemes are accepted in each market, they usually vary from country to country
- **Do** use to provide context beforehand when our merchant is completing a credit card payment
