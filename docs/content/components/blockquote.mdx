# Blockquote

<Status.Stable />

Blockquotes are a way of styling specific text with indention, normally used for demonstrating and highlighting textual information that comes from an external source.

<Playground>
  <Blockquote>The ability to accept credit card payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that.
</Blockquote>
</Playground>

<Props of={Blockquote} />

## When to use it

For highlighting pieces of textual information, usually quotes, that aren't from SumUp directly.
For instance, we should use a blockquote to highlight a quote from a merchant that was interviewed on a blog post regarding product development.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use blockquotes for citing quotes from merchants, partners or other external sources
- **Do not** place an image within a blockquote, they should contain only text.

## Component variations

You can customize the size of the blockquote using the `size` property.
We reccomend always sticking to mega in most cases, since it fits well with the Circuit's default body text size.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Blockquote size={Blockquote.KILO}>Kilo - The ability to accept credit card payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that.
</Blockquote>
    <Blockquote size={Blockquote.MEGA}>Mega - The ability to accept credit card payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that.
</Blockquote>
    <Blockquote size={Blockquote.GIGA}>Giga - The ability to accept credit card payments that are EMV-compliant is essentially an insurance policy against fraud and an impressively economical one at that.
</Blockquote>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>
