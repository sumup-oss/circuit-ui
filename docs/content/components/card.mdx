# Card

Cards are one of the most important elements that give structure for the content we are showing for our
merchants. They group related information and make our product easy to scan and understand.

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <Heading size={Heading.KILO} noMargin>
      Send us a message
      </Heading>
    </CardHeader>
    <Text margin={false}>If you didn't solve your problem using our resource center, please send us a message bellow and we will answer as soon as possible</Text>
    </Card>
  </Playground>

## When to use it

You should use cards whenever you need to present related information in an easy and scannable way for our merchant. 

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always write a heading for your card that expresses clearly what to expect from it
- **Do** order the information on the card according to priority for our merchants
- **Do** place primary buttons on the bottom of the card, especially the main call to action for the next step
- **Do not** place more than one primary button on a card
- **Do not** fill the card with a lot of content. If the card requires too much scrolling, consider breaking it into multiple sections with different cards
- **Do not** place a card 

## Component variations

### Card spacings

Cards come in two spacing variations, mega and giga. Giga
is the default and should be used for most cases.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card spacing={Card.MEGA}>Card with mega spacing</Card>
    <br />
    <Card spacing={Card.GIGA}>Card with giga spacing</Card>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Shadows

A card has three possible different shadows ranging from low intensity (single) to maximum (triple). For most cases,
the single shadow is recommended. 

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card shadow={Card.SINGLE}>Card with single shadow</Card>
    <br />
    <Card shadow={Card.DOUBLE}>Card with double shadow</Card>
    <br />
    <Card shadow={Card.TRIPLE}>Card with triple shadow</Card>
    <br />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## List of cards

You can create a list of cards using `ListView`. You should use it when showing the same type of information within
each card and clicking on it opens contextual information about it. One example is the transaction history, where
each transaction is a card shown on a list and clicking in any one of them shows more information on that particular
transaction.

<Playground>
  <ListView>
    <ListView.Item>
      First card
    </ListView.Item>
    <ListView.Item>
      Second card
    </ListView.Item>
    <ListView.Item>
      Third card
    </ListView.Item>
  </ListView>
</Playground>
