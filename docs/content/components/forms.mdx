# Forms

## Text Field

<Status.Stable />

A text field is an input field for inserting short text and numbers. It has
multiple functions and supports multiple character types/formats.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
    <Input name="input" id="input" placeholder="Placeholder" />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

<Props of={Input} />

### When to use it

When you need short textual information from the user such as email address,
first name, phone number, street name, etc.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** always accompany an input field with a visible label.
- **Do** use one input per row, unless two fields are closely interrelated
  (e.g. first and last name).
- **Do not** use input fields for requiring longer textual information from the
  user.
- **Do not** communicate that an input field is required on the label or the placeholder.
  We assume that everything is required for the user unless explicitly said so.
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks.

### Component variations

#### Disabled text field

You should use only when its a critical information from the user that we
already have or need and we do not want the user to edit it easily. A disabled
field should only be open for editing again if a CTA is clicked.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" disabled placeholder="You cannot type" />
</Playground>

#### Optional text field

We should always strive for not asking optional information from our users. We
recommend using optional inputs only if you feel that information is not
critical and the user could benefit from having it input (such as `cellphone`
in the context of a delivery address).

Remember to always mark the input as optional on the label and never on the
placeholder.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" optional />
</Playground>

#### Invalid text field

When you have a validation logic behind information that is required in
order to continue the form flow.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" invalid placeholder="I am not valid!" />
</Playground>

##### Usage guidelines

- **Do** try to tell that a text input is not valid as soon as we realize it.
- **Do** display the error message that corresponds to the input above the input field.
- **Do** use passive voice in the error message to avoid giving direct blame to
  our users, eg "Password is required" instead of "You didn't set a password"
- **Do not** use long sentences to describe why something is invalid, be direct
  and tell the user how to fix it.
- **Do not** place validation descriptions for formatting such as "Use only
  numbers". We should always try to take care of this automatically for our users
  (such as eliminating space in credit card inputs)

#### Warning text field

Use it when the information that the user inserted, due to our automatic
validations, can affect another setting or attribute of the user's account we
should warn him on the spot (without having to submit before)

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" hasWarning placeholder="I am warning you." />
</Playground>

## Placeholder

An input field must always have a placeholder, which is a short example of the
information required that helps the user to understand what kind of information
is needed. (For instance, an Address Field could have a placeholder:
Grunerstrasse 13)

### When to use it

Always provide a placeholder for text input fields.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** make the placeholder contextual to the language and market.
- **Do not** repeat the same content in the placeholder as the label.
- **Do not** communicate that a field is optional in the placeholder, you
  should do it in the label.

## Label

<Status.Stable />

A label is a short text that explains what information is needed in the text
field. Having a clear and straightforward label not only helps the user to know
what is the purpose of the input but also helps directly with making forms
more accessible.

<Playground>
  <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
</Playground>

<Props of={Label} />

### When to use it

Always provide a label for text input fields.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** adjust the label to include "(optional)" if the corresponding input field is optional.
- **Do** always place the label on top of the input field, aligned to the left.
- **Do not** frame labels as questions (such as _"What is your phone
  number?",_ write "Phone number" instead).
- **Do not** use labels as help text.

## Checkbox

<Status.Stable />

The primary goal of checkboxes is to provide a way for the user to make a range of selections.
The users can select from zero, one, or multiple options. In other words, each checkbox is independent
of all other checkboxes in the list, and checking one box doesn’t uncheck the others.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas">
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

<Props of={Checkbox} />

### When to use it

Use it to ask the users questions with one or multiple alternatives. You could also use it as a way to toggle
an option or agree to certain terms & conditions.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** accompany checkboxes with a descriptive label, except when a checkbox is used to select
  multiple checkboxes (as a parent checkbox).
- **Do** write items in a positive manner. (e.g. _"Send me reports"_ instead of _"Do not send me reports"_)
- **Do** try to display the checkbox list vertically, with one choice per line. If space is
  limited you need to display it horizontally, make sure to separate the buttons and labels from one another.
- **Do** sort the items in a reasonable order (e.g. alphabetical, numerical, time-based, or some other clear system)
- **Do** be as specific as possible.
- **Do** use sentence case (e.g. "I agree..." not "You agree...")
- **Do** use Labels as clicking area for the checkbox
- **Do not** use negations (e.g. _“Don’t send me more email”_)
- **Do not** use checkboxes as an action button.
- **Don not** rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox
- **Do not** use commas or semicolons at the end of each line

### Component variations

#### Invalid checkbox

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" invalid checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" invalid>
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

#### Disabled checkbox

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox
      name="fruit"
      value="apples"
      id="apples"
      disabled
      checked
      onToggle={() => {}}
    >
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox
      name="fruit"
      value="bananas"
      id="bananas"
      disabled
      onToggle={() => {}}
    >
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## Radio button

<Status.InReview />

A radio button is a quick way to extract a single coded answer from our users by presenting multiple
possibilities and allowing only one option to be chosen.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <RadioButton
      name="fruit"
      value="true"
      id="pineapples"
      checked
      onToggle={() => {}}
    >
      Pineapples
    </RadioButton>
    <RadioButton name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" onToggle={() => {}}>
      Bananas
    </RadioButton>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

<Props of={RadioButton} />

### When to use it

Use a radio button when the user has to choose only one option based on a pre-defined list of mutually
exclusive options.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** always associate the radio button with a label that clearly gives context for the user to make a decision
- **Do** capitalize each item of the list
- **Do** list the items in a rational order
- **Do not** use more than 4 options on a list of radio buttons. If it exceeds that, use a selector.
- **Do not** punctuate the end of every list item
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks

### Component variations

##### Disabled Radio Button

Use a disabled radio button only if you really need to communicate to the user that an option that existed
before is not available for choosing now. Keep in mind that you need to communicate why. One recommendation
would be to pair a disabled input with a tooltip to give the appropriate context for our user.

## Select dropdown

A select dropdown is a form field that allows merchants to choose one of the multiple options from a menu.
An example being the expiration date for a users credit card.

<Playground>
  <Select
    onChange={() => {}}
    options={[
      {
        label: 'Option 1',
        value: 1
      },
      {
        label: 'Option 2',
        value: 2
      },
      {
        label: 'Option 3',
        value: 3
      }
    ]}
  />
</Playground>

<Props of={Select} />

### When to use it

Best used when there are 4 or more defined options to choose from (e.g. Months).If there are less than 4 options,
consider using the radio button component.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** clearly label the select dropdown so that the merchant knows what options will be available
- **Do** always provide a default option, typically the placeholder. The default option is not
  selectable but should specify what options will be available.
- **Do** list the options in a logical order. (e.g. Alphabetical, numerical, or in some order that allows the
  merchant to find the option as easy as possible)
- **Do not** use it to save space or tidy up a form.
- **Do not** use it as a way to filter content

## Textarea

<Status.Stable />

It is a type of input that allow mutiple lines of text.

<Playground>
  <TextArea value="Howdy from the text area" />
</Playground>

<Props of={TextArea} />

### When to use it

Text Areas are best used for information that is prompted by an open-ended
question.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do not** use placeholders in text areas.

## Currency input

<Status.InReview/> <Status.Description size={Text.KILO}>Design and styling issues causing overflow</Status.Description>

Currency Input indicates to the merchant that a number should be entered in a given currency.

<Playground>
  <CurrencyInput placeholder="1.234,50" currency="EUR" locale="de-DE" />
</Playground>

<Props of={CurrencyInput} />

### Component Variations

#### Currency

You can use `currency` to specify which currency the input should use.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <CurrencyInput placeholder="CHF: 1'234.50" currency="CHF" locale="de-CH" />
    <CurrencyInput placeholder="RUB: 1 234,50" currency="RUB" locale="ru-RU" />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

#### Locale

You can use `locale` to change the currency formatting locale.
For example, Euros could be formatted differently based on locale:

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <CurrencyInput
      placeholder="de-DE: 1.234,50"
      currency="EUR"
      locale="de-DE"
    />
    <CurrencyInput
      placeholder="en-IE: 1,234.50"
      currency="EUR"
      locale="en-IE"
    />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## Search Input

<Status.Stable />

Search Input is an input that indicates to the merchant they can use the field
to search information on the screen.

<Playground>
  <SearchInput />
</Playground>

<Props of={SearchInput} />

### Component variations

#### Disabled

The search input can be disabled.

<Playground>
  <SearchInput disabled />
</Playground>

## Autocomplete Input

<Status.Stable />

Autocomplete Input suggests input values based on a given list of values.

<Playground>
  <AutoCompleteInput
    placeholder="Start typing"
    items={[
      'apples',
      'bananas',
      'carrots',
      'grapes',
      'oranges',
      'pears',
      'strawberries'
    ]}
    onChange={e => {
      console.log('On change');
    }}
    clearOnSelect={false}
  />
</Playground>

<Props of={AutoCompleteInput} />

## Autocomplete Tags

<Status.Experimental/> <Status.Description size={Text.KILO}>Not currently used in production</Status.Description>

Autocomplete Tags lets the merchant select one or several tags based on a given list of tags.

<Playground>
  <AutoCompleteTags
    placeholder="Start typing"
    availableTags={[
      'apples',
      'bananas',
      'carrots',
      'grapes',
      'oranges',
      'pears',
