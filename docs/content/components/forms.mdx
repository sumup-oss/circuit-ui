# Forms

## Text Field
### A text field is an input field for inserting short text & numbers. It has multiple functions and supports multiple character types/formats/  
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
    <Input name="input" id="input" placeholder="Placeholder" />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

#### When to use it
When you need short textual information from the user such as: email address, first name, phone number, street name, etc.  

| Do's                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ The input field must always be accompanied by a label                                                                                                    |
| ✓ Normally, a row should contain only one text input unless they're up to two contextual information that make sense togeter (such as first and last name) |

| Dont's                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✕ Don't use input fields for requiring longer textual information from the user |
| ✕ Don't communicate that a input field is required                              |
| ✕ Don't mark required fields with asterisks                                     |

## Placeholder
### A input field must always have a placeholder, which is a short example of the information required that helps the user to understand what kind of information is needed. (For instance an Address Field could have as placeholder: Grunerstrasse 13)  

| Do's                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ The placeholder must be succint (up to 3-4 words)                                                                                                 |
| ✓ The placeholder should also be contextual to the language and market |

| Dont's                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✕ The placeholder should not be the exactly same information as the label |
| ✕ Don't communicate that a field is optional in the placeholder, you should do it in the label                              |

### Props
Can't render prop tables for this component because it's exported with `withTheme`.

### Component variations

#### Disabled input
You should use only when its an critical information from the user that we already have or need and we don't want the user to edit it easily. A disabled field should only be open for editing again if a CTA is clicked.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" disabled placeholder="You cannot type"/>
</Playground>

#### Optional input
We should always strive for not asking optional information to our users. We reccomend using optional inputs only if you feel that a information is not critical and the user could benefit for having it inputed (such as `cellphone` in the context of a delivery address).
Remember to always mark the input as optional on the label and never on the placeholder.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" optional />
</Playground>

#### Invalid input
Use it when you have a validation logic behind an information that is required in order to continue the form flow.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" invalid placeholder="I am not valid!" />
</Playground>

| Do's                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ We should always try to tell that a text input is not valid as soon as we realize it.                                                                                                  |
| ✓ The error message should be displayed above the form |
| ✓ We should use passive voice in the error message to avoid giving direct blame to our users, eg "Password is required" instead of "You didn't set a password" |

| Dont's                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✕ Do not use long sentences to describe why something is invalide, be direct and tell the user how to fix it |
| ✕ Do not place validation description for formatting such as "Use only numbers". We should always try take care of this automatically for or users (such as eliminating space in credit card inputs)                               |

#### Warning input
Use it when the information that the user inserted, due to our automatic validations, can affect another setting or attribute of the user's account we should warn him on the spot (without having to submit before) 

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" hasWarning placeholder="I am warning you." />
</Playground>

## Label
### A label is a short text that explains what information we need from the text field. 

<Playground>
  <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
</Playground>

| Do's                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ Be succinct, maximum 3-4 words                                                                                                 |
| ✓ If a text input is optional, you should tell it in the label as: "(optional)" |
| ✓ Always place the label in top of the input field, aligned to the left" |

| Dont's                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✕ Don't frame label as questions (such as "What is your phone number?", write "Phone number" directly). |
| ✕ Don't use labels as help text                               |


<PropTable component={Label}/>

## Checkbox

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas">
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Best practices
- Use different shadows.

### Usage guidelines
- Every card should be a logical combination of its contents.

### Component variations

#### Invalid
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" invalid checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" invalid>
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

#### Disabled
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" disabled checked onToggle={() => {}}>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" disabled onToggle={() => {}}>
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## Radio button

#### Definition
A radio button is a quick way to extract a single coded answer from our users by presenting multiple possibilities and allowing only one option to be chosen. 

#### When to use it
Use a radio button when the user has to choose only one option based on a pre-defined list of mutually exclusive options.
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <RadioButton name="fruit" value="true" id="pineapples" checked onToggle={() => {}}>
      Pineapples
    </RadioButton>
    <RadioButton name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" onToggle={() => {}}>
      Bananas
    </RadioButton>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

| Do's                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ The radio button must always be associated with a label that clearly gives context for the user to make a decision                                                                                                    |
| ✓ Capitalize each item of the list |
| ✓ List the items in a rational order|

| Dont's                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✕ Don't use more than 4 options on a list of radio buttons. If it exceeds that, use a selector.|
| ✕ Don't punctuate the end of every list item                              |
| ✕ Don't mark required fields with asterisks                                    |

### Component variations

##### Disabled Radio Button
Use a disabled radio button only if you really need to communicate to the user that a option that existed before is not available for choosing now. Keep in mind that you need to communicate why. One recommendation would be to pair a disabled input with a tooltip to give the appropriate context for our user.

## Select
<Playground>
  <Select onChange={() => {}} options={[
    {
      label: "Option 1",
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: "Option 2",
      value: 2
    },
    {
      label: "Option 3",
      value: 3
    }
  ]} />
</Playground>

### Component variations
#### Invalid Select
<Playground>
  <Select invalid onChange={() => {}} options={[
    {
      label: "Option 1",
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: "Option 2",
      value: 2
    },
    {
      label: "Option 3",
      value: 3
    }
  ]} />
</Playground>

### Best practices
- Use different shadows.

### Usage guidelines
- Every card should be a logical combination of its contents.

### Component variations

## Textarea

<Playground>
  <TextArea value="Howdy from the textarea"/>
</Playground>

### Best practices

### Usage guidelines

### Component variations

The textarea component can take all the same variations as the Input component,
namely being `optional`, `disabled`, `invalid`, or `showWarning`.
