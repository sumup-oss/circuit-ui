# Forms

## Text Field

A text field is an input field for inserting short text and numbers. It has
multiple functions and supports multiple character types/formats.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
    <Input name="input" id="input" placeholder="Placeholder" />
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### When to use it

When you need short textual information from the user such as: email address,
first name, phone number, street name, etc.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** always accompany an input field with a visible label.
- **Do** use one input per row, unless two fields are closely interrelated
  (e.g. first and last name).
- **Do not** use input fields for requiring longer textual information from the
  user.
- **Do not** communicate that an input field is required.
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✓ The placeholder must be succint (up to 3-4 words)                                                                                                 |
| ✓ The placeholder should also be contextual to the language and market |

#### Disabled input

You should use only when its an critical information from the user that we
already have or need and we don't want the user to edit it easily. A disabled
field should only be open for editing again if a CTA is clicked.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" disabled placeholder="You cannot type"/>
</Playground>

#### Optional input

We should always strive for not asking optional information from our users. We
recommend using optional inputs only if you feel that information is not
critical and the user could benefit from having it input (such as `cellphone`
in the context of a delivery address).

Remember to always mark the input as optional on the label and never on the
placeholder.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" optional />
</Playground>

#### Invalid input

When you have a validation logic behind an information that is required in
order to continue the form flow.

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" invalid placeholder="I am not valid!" />
</Playground>

##### Usage guidelines

- **Do** try to tell that a text input is not valid as soon as we realize it.
- **Do** display the error message that corresponds to the input above the input field.
- **Do** use passive voice in the error message to avoid giving direct blame to
  our users, eg "Password is required" instead of "You didn't set a password"
- **Do not** use long sentences to describe why something is invalid, be direct
  and tell the user how to fix it.
- **Do not** place validation descriptions for formatting such as "Use only
  numbers". We should always try take care of this automatically for our users
  (such as eliminating space in credit card inputs)

#### Warning input

Use it when the information that the user inserted, due to our automatic
validations, can affect another setting or attribute of the user's account we
should warn him on the spot (without having to submit before) 

<Playground>
  <Input name="input" id="input" hasWarning placeholder="I am warning you." />
</Playground>

### Placeholder

An input field must always have a placeholder, which is a short example of the
information required that helps the user to understand what kind of information
is needed. (For instance an Address Field could have as placeholder:
Grunerstrasse 13)

#### When to use it

Always provide a placeholder for text input fields.

#### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** make the placeholder contextual to the language and market.
- **Do not** not repeat the same content in the placeholder as the label.
- **Do not** communicate that a field is optional in the placeholder, you
  should do it in the label.

## Label

A label is a short text that explains what information is needed in the text
field. Having a clear and straightforward label not only helps the user to know
what is the purpose of the input, but also helps directly with making forms
more accessible.

#### Definition
A label is a short text that explains what information we need from the text field. 

Do's
- Always use short labels, maximum 3-4 words
- If a text input is optional, you should tell it in the label as: "(optional)"

<Playground>
  <Label htmlFor="name">Label</Label>
</Playground>

<PropTable component={Label}/>

### When to use it

Always provide a label for text input fields.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** adjust the label to include "(optional)" if the corresponding input field is optional.
- **Do** always place the label in top of the input field, aligned to the left.
- **Do not** Don't frame labels as questions (such as *"What is your phone
  number?",* write "Phone number" instead).
- **Do not** use labels as help text.

## Checkbox

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas">
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Best practices

### Usage guidelines

### Component variations

#### Invalid
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" invalid checked>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" invalid>
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

#### Disabled
<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="apples" id="apples" disabled checked onToggle={() => {}}>
      Apples
    </Checkbox>
    <Checkbox name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" disabled onToggle={() => {}}>
      Bananas
    </Checkbox>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## Radio button

#### Definition

A radio button is a quick way to extract a single coded answer from our users by presenting multiple possibilities and allowing only one option to be chosen. 

#### When to use it
Use a radio button when the user has to choose only one option based on a pre-defined list of mutually exclusive options.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <RadioButton name="fruit" value="true" id="pineapples" checked onToggle={() => {}}>
      Pineapples
    </RadioButton>
    <RadioButton name="fruit" value="bananas" id="bananas" onToggle={() => {}}>
      Bananas
    </RadioButton>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Component variations

##### Disabled Radio Button

Use a disabled radio button only if you really need to communicate to the user
that a option that existed before is not available for choosing now. Keep in
mind that you need to communicate why. One recommendation would be to pair a
disabled input with a tooltip to give the appropriate context for our user.

## Select

<Playground>
  <Select onChange={() => {}} options={[
    {
      label: "Option 1",
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: "Option 2",
      value: 2
    },
    {
      label: "Option 3",
      value: 3
    }
  ]} />
</Playground>

### Component variations

#### Invalid Select

<Playground>
  <Select invalid onChange={() => {}} options={[
    {
      label: "Option 1",
      value: 1
    },
    {
      label: "Option 2",
      value: 2
    },
    {
      label: "Option 3",
      value: 3
    }
  ]} />
</Playground>

### Best practices

### Usage guidelines

### Component variations

## Textarea

A text area input is a type of input that has more than one line of text. Such
types of input are used for when the expected text is more than one line.

<Playground>
  <TextArea value="Howdy from the textarea"/>
</Playground>

### Usage guidelines

Text Areas are best used for information that is prompted by an open ended
question.

- **Do** not use placeholders in text areas.

### Component variations

The textarea component can take all the same variations as the Input component,
namely being `optional`, `disabled`, `invalid`, or `showWarning`.
