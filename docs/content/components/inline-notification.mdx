# Inline notification

<Status.InReview/> <Status.Description size={Text.KILO}>Likely to be renamed</Status.Description>

Inline notification is a component that provides a short contextual message about an action taken by our merchants within the same card structure that they are in.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card>
      <InlineNotification type={InlineNotification.DANGER} noMargin>
        This combination of email address and password is incorrect.
      </InlineNotification>
    </Card>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

<Props of={InlineNotification} />

## When to use it

Use it when we need to provide contextual information that highlights errors or warnings after the information has been inputted by our merchants.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always place the inline notification above the primary call to action
- **Do** make it clear for our merchants what they need to in order to fix the possible error
- **Do not** place an inline notification in another card, it should always be in the same card where the information that merchant input is

## Component variants

### Success

Used to provide positive feedback without taking the merchant to another screen, such as updating the configuration
on a settings page.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card>
      <InlineNotification type={InlineNotification.SUCCESS} noMargin>
        Your settings have been updated with success!
      </InlineNotification>
    </Card>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Warning

Used to warn merchants regarding information that is not obligatory to fill or input, but it
could provide additional help if the fill it.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card>
      <InlineNotification type={InlineNotification.WARNING} noMargin>
        You are proceeding without a contact information in your shipping order.
        This might make it harder for us to reach you if we have a problem
        delivering it.
      </InlineNotification>
    </Card>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Danger

The most common inline notification type. Used to provide feedback that we cannot proceed forward in completing
a task for the user (such as a login) if they don't fix what's wrong. Remember to always provide context on how
to exactly solve the problem.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Card>
      <InlineNotification type={InlineNotification.DANGER} noMargin>
        This combination of email address and password is incorrect.
      </InlineNotification>
    </Card>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>
