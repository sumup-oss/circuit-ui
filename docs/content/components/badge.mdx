# Badge

Badges are non-actionable elements in the UI, used to indicate status of an object.

<Playground>
  <Badge>Badge</Badge>
</Playground>

## Best practices

- Use our colour patterns so that merchants can learn and identify status on a
  glance.
- Create a clear label with a short, scannable text.
- Position a badge so that it is obvious what content the status is related to.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use badges to indicate the status of data rows in a table.
- **Do** use badges to bring attention to a specific area on the screen (like a
  new feature).
- **Do not** use badges to indicate default statuses (e.g. in the Transaction
  History, a transaction should only include a status if it's anything other
  than default; failed, refunded, paid out, etc.)

## Component variations

### Semantic badges

The badges come in a number of colors based on their semantic meaning.

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Badge color={Badge.NEUTRAL}>Badge</Badge>
    <Badge color={Badge.PRIMARY}>Badge</Badge>
    <Badge color={Badge.SUCCESS}>Badge</Badge>
    <Badge color={Badge.WARNING}>Badge</Badge>
    <Badge color={Badge.DANGER}>Badge</Badge>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Circular badges

Badges that receive the `circle` prop can be used to indicate notifications.

<Playground>
  <Badge circle color={Badge.DANGER}>
    5
  </Badge>
</Playground>
