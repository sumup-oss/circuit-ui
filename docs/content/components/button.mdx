# Button

<Playground>
  <Button primary>Button</Button>
</Playground>

<Props of={Button} />

## Best practices

- Be clearly and accurately labeled.
- Lead with strong actionable words.
- Use established button colors appropriately.
- Prioritize the most important actions.

## Usage guidelines

### Components in a group

- The primary action belongs on the right.

### Content guidelines

- Start with a verb.

## Component variations

### Default buttons

The default button can be used as a primary button if it's being displayed
on a dark background.

<Playground>
  <Button>Button</Button>
</Playground>

### Primary buttons

A button should be primary if it's the primary action that a user should take
on the page. In most cases, there should be only one primary button visible
at a time.

<Playground>
  <Button primary>Button</Button>
</Playground>

### Secondary buttons

A secondary button offers an alternative action to the primary button.
Usually the secondary button signals actions such as "Cancel".

<Playground>
  <Button secondary>Button</Button>
</Playground>

### Flat buttons

A secondary button offers an alternative action to the primary button.
Usually the secondary button signals actions such as "Cancel".

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Button flat primary>
      Button
    </Button>
    <Button flat secondary>
      Button
    </Button>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

### Plain buttons

Plain buttons are meant to look like links. Whether they render with an
`<a>` tag or a `<button>` tag depends on whether you pass an `href`
property to the component.

<Playground>
  <Button plain primary href="#">
    I look like a link
  </Button>
</Playground>

### Sized buttons

<Playground>
  <Fragment>
    <Button size={Button.KILO}>Button</Button>
    <Button size={Button.MEGA}>Button</Button>
    <Button size={Button.GIGA}>Button</Button>
  </Fragment>
</Playground>

## Button Groups

Use ButtonGroup to group buttons, for example when the UI gives the user a choice between saving or cancelling an action.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button secondary>Cancel</Button>
    <Button primary>Save</Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>
