# Toggle

<Status.Stable />

The toggle is a switcher between two mutually exclusive states: on and off.

<Playground>
  <State initial={false} name="on" updaterName="onChange" updater={on => !on}>
    {({ onChange, on }) => (
      <Toggle
        label="Receive marketing and promotional materials"
        explanation="If this option is active you will receive weekly promotional materials in your email"
        onChange={e => {
          onChange(e);
        }}
        {...{ on }}
      />
    )}
  </State>
</Playground>

<Props of={Toggle} />

## When to use it

When the merchant needs to make a selection (turn on or off a setting) that will immediately happen,
without having the confirm the action.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always provide a default option for our merchant (when in doubt, leave it off)
- **Do** use the `explanation` tag to be even more detailed about what the toggle is about
- **Do not** use a toggle when the effect from the change does not take effect immediately

## Content guidelines

- **Do** always be clear and precise in what the toggle turns on and off
- **Do not** frame the label as a question
