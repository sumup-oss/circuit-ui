# Calendar

<Status.InReview/> <Status.Description size={Text.KILO}>Likely to be renamed</Status.Description>

A calendar contains a view with actionable buttons in order to pick a range of dates
and time frames for a specific task.

<Playground>
  <RangePicker />
</Playground>

## When to use it

Calendars are used when we need our merchants to pick a specific time period in order to complete a task
or filter a subset of dated items (such as the transaction history, for example).

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** suggest frequently used selections, such as "Today", "Last month", and others.
- **Do** use the proper component variation depending on how you need the data input
- **Do not** use it when requiring dates very far from the present, such as a birth date.

## Component variations

### Range Picker

<Status.InReview />

Used when the merchant needs to have clear visibility of selected start and end dates after the selection,
for instance when a merchant needs to pick a time period within a form.

<Playground>
  <RangePicker />
</Playground>

### Single Day Picker

<Status.InReview />

Used when you the merchant only needs to select a single specific date.

<Playground>
  <SingleDayPicker />
</Playground>

### Calendar Tag

<Status.InReview />

Used for cases where the merchant needs to select dates within the same month and that selection affects the data displayed.

<Playground>
  <CalendarTag
    onDatesRangeChange={e => {
      console.log(e);
    }}
  />
</Playground>

### Calendar Tag Two Step

<Status.InReview />

Used for cases where the merchant needs to select dates that could be outside the same month and that selection affects the data displayed.

<Playground>
  <CalendarTagTwoStep
    onDatesRangeChange={e => {
      console.log(e);
    }}
  />
</Playground>
