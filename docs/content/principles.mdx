# Principles

## Obvious and transparent naming

Our components should use names that are as standard as possible.  Opt for a
more verbose name rather than a creative or clever one. When in doubt, look to
several other component libraries for inspiration.

### Component and prop-naming guidelines

- Try for one- or two-word component names.
- Try for one-word props if possible.
- Similarly, use onVerb handlers (e.g. "onClick") and stick to the DOM names when possible.
- Labels in English should accept translated values, with default props in English.
- Keep it concise without being clever.

```javascript
// Do
<DatePicker onClick={fn} nextButton="Next" prevButton="Previous" />

// Don't
<CustomDatePicker selectDate={fn} />
```

## Keep the API small

- Don't expose underlying utilies or internals unless necessary.

## Label elements with BEM

## Ensure accessibility and autocompletion

## TBD
