## Design Principles

## Development Principles

When developing components in Circuit UI, we have a few development principles
you should keep in mind. They will help you with picking good names, design
clear and understandable APIs, and keep things consistent.

### Naming principles

**Use obvious and transparent naming.** Our components should use names that
are as standard as possible. Opt for a more verbose name rather than a creative
or clever one. When in doubt, you can look at several other component libraries
for inspiration.

**Opt for one- or two-word component and prop names.** When possible, stay
concise as long as you can remain clear as well.

**Handlers should be written as `onVerb`.** Or (if needed) `onVerbNoun` rather
than `onNounVerb`. For example, if you cannot reasonably name your event
handler `onSelect` because it is overly vague for your use-case, instead opt
for something like `onSelectFruit` rather than `onFruitSelect`.

If at all possible, stick to standard names you'd find in the DOM or React APIs like
`onClick`. This helps make our APIs more predictable!

```javascript
// Do: Use standard component names and short prop names
<DatePicker onClick={fn} nextButton="Next" prevButton="Previous" />

// Don't: Come up with unusual component names or name handlers without the `on` prefix
<CustomDatePicker selectDate={fn} />
```

### Component design principles

**Keep the API small.** As much as possible, avoid exposing too many options
for configuring a component.  The exception is if you are wrapping an existing
third-party library, you may have a good reason to simply pass along all
additional props to ensure API compatibility with that third-party library.

### Best practices

**Every component must be thoroughly tested.** If the component is purely
representative (e.g. simple, styled components), a snapshot test is sufficient.
If the component is interactive, you should do your best to test the
interaction on a unit level.

**Ensure accessibility and autocompletion.** Every component should have a
minimum of an accessibility test asserted with jest-axe. You should also make a
special effort to properly enable autocompletion for relevant fields, using the
proper input names and autocomplete properties.

**All translated text should be provided as props with English defaults.** It
must be possible for all user-facing text inside a component to be replaced
with translated versions. This also makes it easier to stick to content
guidelines by providing a good starting example.

**Documentation is part of your component.** Be sure to write meaningful documentation about best practices / usage guidelines when creating or updating existing components. You can even use existing documentation for reference.
