# Label

<Status.Stable />

A label is a short text that explains what information is needed in the text
field. Having a clear and straightforward label not only helps the user to know
what is the purpose of the input but also helps directly with making forms
more accessible.

<Story id="forms-label--base" />

<Props of={Label} />

## When to use it

Always provide a label for text input fields.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** adjust the label to include "(optional)" if the corresponding input field is optional.
- **Do** always place the label on top of the input field, aligned to the left.
- **Do not** frame labels as questions (such as _"What is your phone
  number?",_ write "Phone number" instead).
- **Do not** use labels as help text.
