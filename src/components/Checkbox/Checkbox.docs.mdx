# Checkbox

<Status.Stable />

The primary goal of checkboxes is to provide a way for the user to make a range of selections.
The users can select from zero, one, or multiple options. In other words, each checkbox is independent
of all other checkboxes in the list, and checking one box doesn’t uncheck the others.

<Story id="forms-checkbox--base" />
<Props of={Checkbox} />

## When to use it

Use it to ask the users questions with one or multiple alternatives. You could also use it as a way to toggle
an option or agree to certain terms & conditions.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** accompany checkboxes with a descriptive label, except when a checkbox is used to select
  multiple checkboxes (as a parent checkbox).
- **Do** write items in a positive manner. (e.g. _"Send me reports"_ instead of _"Do not send me reports"_)
- **Do** try to display the checkbox list vertically, with one choice per line. If space is
  limited you need to display it horizontally, make sure to separate the buttons and labels from one another.
- **Do** sort the items in a reasonable order (e.g. alphabetical, numerical, time-based, or some other clear system)
- **Do** be as specific as possible.
- **Do** use sentence case (e.g. "I agree..." not "You agree...")
- **Do** use Labels as clicking area for the checkbox
- **Do not** use negations (e.g. _“Don’t send me more email”_)
- **Do not** use checkboxes as an action button.
- **Don not** rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox
- **Do not** use commas or semicolons at the end of each line
