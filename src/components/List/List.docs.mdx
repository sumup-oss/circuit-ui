# List

<Status.Stable />

At its core, the list component allows you to easily display a related content grouped together and organized vertically. They should be used to present simple pieces of information. For more complex sets of data, consider using aÂ Data Table.

<Story id="components-list--base" />
<Props of={List} />

## When to use it

Use it when you want to display a list of text-only related items.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** break up chunks of related content and make the information easier for users to scan
- **Do** use sentence casing
- **Do** arrange List items in a logical way. Try to sort items into smaller meaningful categories.
  Specific lists might be more useful in some contexts. If sorting is not possible, organize in alphabetical
  or numerical order
- **Do not** show more than 2 columns on mobile view

## Component Variants

### Variants

Use an ordered list to imply sequence and order. Ordered lists are commonly used when providing a set of instructions.

Use an unordered list to present content of equal status or value.

<Story id="components-list--variant" />

### Sizes

The size of the list should be the same as the surrounding content.

<Story id="components-list--size" />

### Nested

Nested lists are indented.

<Story id="components-list--nested" />
