# CardList

<Status.InReview />

You can create a list of cards using `CardList`. You should use it when showing the same type of information within each card and clicking on it opens contextual information about it. One example is the transaction history, where each transaction is a card shown on a list and clicking in any one of them shows more information on that particular transaction.
