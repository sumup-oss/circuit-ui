# InlineMessage

<Status.Stable />

Inline message is a component that provides a short contextual message about an action taken by a user within the same card structure that they are in.

<Story id="forms-inlinemessage--base" />
<Props of={InlineMessage} />

## When to use it

Use it when we need to provide contextual information that highlights errors or warnings after the information has been inputted by a user.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always place the inline message above the primary call to action
- **Do** make it clear for our users what they need to do in order to fix the possible error
- **Do not** place an inline message in another card, it should always be in the same card as the input it is referring to

## Component variants

### Success

Used to provide positive feedback without taking the user to another screen, such as updating the configuration
on a settings page.

<Story id="forms-inlinemessage--success" />

### Warning

Used to warn users regarding information that is not obligatory to fill or input, but it
could provide additional help if the fill it.

<Story id="forms-inlinemessage--warning" />

### Alert

The most common inline message type. Used to provide feedback that we cannot proceed forward in completing a task for the user (such as a login) if they don't fix what's wrong. Remember to always provide concrete instructions on how to solve the problem.
