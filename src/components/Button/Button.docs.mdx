# Button

<Status.InReview />

A button allows us to highlight actions in the product and make them easily
perceived and achievable through just one click.

<Props of={Button} />

## When to use it

Use buttons when users need to either navigate through a product or perform a specific task.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always label a button in a clear and understandable way
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action to be taken when choosing a type of button
- **Do** position buttons in a predictable and coherent way throughout the product.
- **Do** combine different button types if you have more than one button in a specific screen
- **Do** use a loading state to provide feedback for our user when the action revolves around saving or
  inputting information, especially when it could take some seconds.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** always start the label with an actionable verb accompanied by a noun to provide enough context (example: "Confirm order").
  The only exceptions are the following common actions: "Save"; "Cancel"; and "Close".
- **Do** keep the label to a maximum of 3 words
- **Do not** capitalize all words of the label, just the first word or brand/product words (such as Apple Pay, for example)

## Component variations

### Primary button

Used to highlight the most important action in a certain page. In most cases, there should be only one primary button visible
at a time.

<Story id="components-button--primary" />

### Default button

Used to highlight secondary actions to be takes, specially when there's already a primary action on the page.

<Story id="components-button--base" />

### Secondary button

Only use secondary buttons when paired to a primary button, placed in the left side of it. They are used to
signal opposite actions from the primary button, such as "Cancel order".

<Story id="components-button--secondary" />

### Plain button

Used when you want to highlight an action within a body text. It should always open in the same window unless
it links to an external source (such as a link to a complete study about card acceptance within a blog post).

### Button sizes

The button component also supports three different sizes: Mega, the best suitable for most cases; Kilo, used
when there is sizing constraints in the button position; and Giga, used for extreme cases when there's little
or no constraint on the button's placement.

<Story id="components-button--size" />

## Button group

Used when our user has two opposites actions to be taken in a certain step of a flow. It is generally used aligned to the right,
with a primary button for the expected action and a secondary button on its left.

<Story id="components-button-buttongroup--base" />
<Props of={ButtonGroup} />

- **Do** use the same verb tenses for both actions

## Loading button

When the button's action is inputting/saving information or it takes more than 3 seconds to take the user to the next step/page, you can indicate a loading state with `LoadingButton`, as well as visually notify the user of success or an error after loading. You should only use it on primary buttons.

<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--success-animation" />
<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--error-animation" />
<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--no-exit-animation" />
<Props of={LoadingButton} />
