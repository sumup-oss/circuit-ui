# Button

<Status.Stable />

A button allows us to highlight actions in the product and make them easily perceived and achievable through just one click.

<Story id="components-button--primary" />
<Props of={Button} />

## When to use it

Use buttons when users need to either navigate through a product or perform a specific action.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always label a button in a clear and understandable way
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action to be taken when choosing a type of button
- **Do** position buttons in a predictable and coherent way throughout the product.
- **Do** combine different button types if you have more than one button in a specific screen
- **Do** use a loading state to provide feedback for our user when the action revolves around saving or
  inputting information, especially when it could take some seconds.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** always start the label with an actionable verb accompanied by a noun to provide enough context (example: "Confirm order").
  The only exceptions are the following common actions: "Save"; "Cancel"; and "Close".
- **Do** keep the label to a maximum of 3 words
- **Do not** capitalize all words of the label, just the first word or brand/product words (such as Apple Pay, for example)

## Component variations

### Primary

The **primary button** should be used for the most important actions. There should always be just one primary button visible at a time on the screen.

### Secondary

The **secondary button** should be used for secondary actions to compliment a primary action, or when multiple actions of equal importance are required.

<Story id="components-button--secondary" />

### Tertiary

The **tertiary button** should be used for supportive actions, and can be paired with the primary or the secondary button.

<Story id="components-button--tertiary" />

### Sizes

The button component supports 3 different sizes:

- **mega**, the default size
- **kilo**, used when there are sizing constraints
- **giga**, used for extreme cases when there is no constraint on the button's size

<Story id="components-button--sizes" />

## ButtonGroup

Used when users have two opposite actions to be taken in a certain step of a flow. It is generally used aligned to the right,
with a primary button for the expected action and a secondary button on its left.

<Story id="components-button-buttongroup--base" />
<Props of={ButtonGroup} />

- **Do** use the same verb tenses for both actions

## LoadingButton

When the button's action is inputting/saving information or it takes more than 3 seconds to take the user to the next step/page, you can indicate a loading state with `LoadingButton`, as well as visually notify the user of success or an error after loading. You should only use it on primary buttons.

<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--base" />
<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--success" />
<Story id="components-button-loadingbutton--error" />
<Props of={LoadingButton} />
