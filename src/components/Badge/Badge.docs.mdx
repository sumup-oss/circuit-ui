# Badge

<Status.Stable />

Badges are non-actionable elements in the UI, used to indicate the status of an object.

<Story id="components-badge--base" />
<Props />

## Best practices

- Use our colour patterns so that users can learn and identify status at a glance.
- Create a clear label with a short, scannable text.
- Position a badge so that it is obvious what content the status is related to.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** use badges to indicate the status of data rows in a table.
- **Do** use badges to bring attention to a specific area on the screen (like a
  new feature).
- **Do not** use badges to indicate default statuses (e.g. in the Transaction History, a transaction should only include a status if it's anything other than default; failed, refunded, paid out, etc.)

## Component variations

### Variants

The badges come in a number of variants based on their semantic meaning.

<Story id="components-badge--variants" />

### Circular badges

Badges that receive the `circle` prop can be used to indicate notifications.

<Story id="components-badge--circular" />

### Static HTML

Here is an example how to build a non-React badge using [static CSS](Advanced/Static-CSS).

<Story id="components-badge--static" />
