# Input

<Status.Stable />

A text field is an input field for inserting short text and numbers. It has
multiple functions and supports multiple character types/formats.

<Story id="forms-input--base" />

<Props of={Input} />

## When to use it

When you need short textual information from the user such as email address,
first name, phone number, street name, etc.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always accompany an input field with a visible label.
- **Do** use one input per row, unless two fields are closely interrelated
  (e.g. first and last name).
- **Do not** use input fields for requiring longer textual information from the
  user.
- **Do not** communicate that an input field is required on the label or the placeholder.
  We assume that everything is required for the user unless explicitly said so.
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks.

## Component variations

### Disabled

You should use only when its a critical information from the user that we
already have or need and we do not want the user to edit it easily. A disabled
field should only be open for editing again if a CTA is clicked.

<Story id="forms-input--disabled" />

### Optional

We should always strive for not asking optional information from our users. We
recommend using optional inputs only if you feel that information is not
critical and the user could benefit from having it input (such as `cellphone`
in the context of a delivery address).

Remember to always mark the input as optional on the label and never on the
placeholder.

<Story id="forms-input--optional" />

### Invalid

When you have a validation logic behind information that is required in
order to continue the form flow.

<Story id="forms-input--invalid" />

#### Usage guidelines

- **Do** try to tell that a text input is not valid as soon as we realize it.
- **Do** display the error message that corresponds to the input above the input field.
- **Do** use passive voice in the error message to avoid giving direct blame to
  our users, eg "Password is required" instead of "You didn't set a password"
- **Do not** use long sentences to describe why something is invalid, be direct
  and tell the user how to fix it.
- **Do not** place validation descriptions for formatting such as "Use only
  numbers". We should always try to take care of this automatically for our users
  (such as eliminating space in credit card inputs)

### Warning

Use it when the information that the user inserted, due to our automatic
validations, can affect another setting or attribute of the user's account we
should warn him on the spot (without having to submit before)

<Story id="forms-input--warning" />

## Placeholder

An input field must always have a placeholder, which is a short example of the
information required that helps the user to understand what kind of information
is needed. (For instance, an Address Field could have a placeholder:
Grunerstrasse 13)

### When to use it

Always provide a placeholder for text input fields.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** make the placeholder succinct (up to 3-4 words).
- **Do** make the placeholder contextual to the language and market.
- **Do not** repeat the same content in the placeholder as the label.
- **Do not** communicate that a field is optional in the placeholder, you
  should do it in the label.
