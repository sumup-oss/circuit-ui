# Calendar

<Status.InReview/><Status.Description>Likely to be renamed. Prop names likely to be changed.</Status.Description>

A calendar contains a view with actionable buttons in order to pick a range of dates
and time frames for a specific task.

## When to use it

Calendars are used when we need our merchants to pick a specific time period in order to complete a task
or filter a subset of dated items (such as the transaction history, for example).

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** suggest frequently used selections, such as "Today", "Last month", and others.
- **Do** use the proper component variation depending on how you need the data input
- **Do not** use it when requiring dates very far from the present, such as a birth date.

## Component variations

### Range Picker

<Status.InReview />

Used when the merchant needs to have clear visibility of selected start and end dates after the selection,
for instance when a merchant needs to pick a time period within a form.
