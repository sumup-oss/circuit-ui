# Selector

<Status.Stable />

The selector is a component that allows users to select a single option from a range of items, keeping that selection
highlighted and allowing possible changes to happen on the same screen based on it.

<Story id="forms-selector--base" />

<Props of={Selector} />

## When to use it

We should use a selector when we need the user to choose a critical option on the flows that impact the
same screen that they are currently in. For example, choosing a payment method on the order flow.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always position the selectable options on the same horizontal line for easy comparison
- **Do** provide the possible change on the content below the selector (for instance showing credit card input fields if users select this type of payment)
- **Do not** use a selector for more than 3 items. Consider using a select dropdown, instead.

## Component variations

### Selected option

<Story id="forms-selector--selected" />

### Disabled option

<Story id="forms-selector--disabled" />
