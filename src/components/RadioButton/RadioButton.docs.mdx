# RadioButton

<Status.Stable />

A radio button is a quick way to extract a single coded answer from our users by presenting multiple
possibilities and allowing only one option to be chosen.

<Story id="forms-radiobutton--base" />

<Props of={RadioButton} />

## When to use it

Use a radio button when the user has to choose only one option based on a pre-defined list of mutually
exclusive options.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always associate the radio button with a label that clearly gives context for the user to make a decision
- **Do** capitalize each item of the list
- **Do** list the items in a rational order
- **Do not** use more than 4 options on a list of radio buttons. If it exceeds that, use a selector.
- **Do not** punctuate the end of every list item
- **Do not** mark required fields with asterisks

## Component variations

### Disabled Radio Button

Use a disabled radio button only if you really need to communicate to the user that an option that existed
before is not available for choosing now. Keep in mind that you need to communicate why. One recommendation
would be to pair a disabled input with a tooltip to give the appropriate context for our user.

<Story id="forms-radiobutton--disabled" />

### Invalid

<Story id="forms-radiobutton--invalid" />

## RadioButtonGroup

<Story id="forms-radiobutton-radiobuttongroup--base" />

<Props of={RadioButtonGroup} />
