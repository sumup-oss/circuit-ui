# Notification

<Status.Stable />

Notifications are a quick and subtle way of providing contextual feedback for our users through floating
or fixed cards with a semantical meaning (either success, danger or attention).

<Story id="components-notification--base" />

<Props of={Notification} />
<Props of={NotificationIcon} />
<Props of={NotificationButton} />

## When to use it

Notifications are used to serve our users with subtle informative snippets or feedback
on a given action.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** allow users to dismiss all notifications unless immediate action is required.
- **Do** direct users to the relevant place with a CTA if action is required.
- **Do** use feedback notifications to validate an action has been completed.
- **Do** use the correct badge colour to signify sentiment of a notification.
- **Do not** use attention notifications unless a vital action is required.
- **Do not** use the notifications component if our feedback for the user is super critical,
  such as an order's payment confirmation. Its subtle aspect could make it hard for them to have
  a strong confirmation of what just happened.

## Component variations

### Feedback notifications

Used to provide feedback to a user after an action
has been taken. These notifications disappear automatically.

<Story id="components-notification--success" />

### Informative notifications

Can contain information which isn't essential but may
be useful to the user. (e.g. New feature announcement) It is recommended
to use a call to action.

<Story id="components-notification--warning" />

### Attention notifications

When action is required by the user, attention
notifications should be used and should clearly highlight which action is
required. **A call to action must be displayed.**

<Story id="components-notification--alert" />

## NotificationBanner

You can display a banner with a notification with `NotificationBanner`, and position it at the top or bottom of a view.

<Story id="components-notification-notificationbanner--base" />

<Props of={NotificationBanner} />

## NotificationList

You can display a list of notifications with `NotificationList`.

<Story id="components-notification-notificationlist--base" />

<Props of={NotificationList} />
