# Inline notification

<Status.InReview/><Status.Description>Likely to be renamed.</Status.Description>

Inline notification is a component that provides a short contextual message about an action taken by a user within the same card structure that they are in.

<Story id="forms-inlinenotification--base" />

<Props of={InlineNotification} />

## When to use it

Use it when we need to provide contextual information that highlights errors or warnings after the information has been inputted by a user.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always place the inline notification above the primary call to action
- **Do** make it clear for our users what they need to do in order to fix the possible error
- **Do not** place an inline notification in another card, it should always be in the same card as the input it is referring to

## Component variants

### Success

Used to provide positive feedback without taking the user to another screen, such as updating the configuration
on a settings page.

Used to warn users regarding information that is not obligatory to fill or input, but it
could provide additional help if the fill it.
