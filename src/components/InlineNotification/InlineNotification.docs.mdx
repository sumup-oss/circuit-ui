# Inline notification

<Status.InReview/><Status.Description>Likely to be renamed.</Status.Description>

Inline notification is a component that provides a short contextual message about an action taken by a user within the same card structure that they are in.

<Story id="forms-inlinenotification--base" />

<Props of={InlineNotification} />

## When to use it

Use it when we need to provide contextual information that highlights errors or warnings after the information has been inputted by a user.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always place the inline notification above the primary call to action
- **Do** make it clear for our users what they need to do in order to fix the possible error
- **Do not** place an inline notification in another card, it should always be in the same card as the input it is referring to

## Component variants

### Success

Used to provide positive feedback without taking the user to another screen, such as updating the configuration
on a settings page.

### Warning

Used to warn users regarding information that is not obligatory to fill or input, but it
could provide additional help if the fill it.

The most common inline notification type. Used to provide feedback that we cannot proceed forward in completing a task for the user (such as a login) if they don't fix what's wrong. Remember to always provide concrete instructions on how to solve the problem.
